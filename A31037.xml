            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREMONITION TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THis Portraiture of the <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> I have here drawn and ſet before thee, (though not drawn at full length) this Deſcription of the <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Man</hi> by ſeveral Scripture-Caracters, as <hi>parts</hi> of him; as by the <hi>Eye</hi> of Knowledg, the <hi>Face</hi> of Repentance (turning from Sin to God) the <hi>Hand</hi> of Faith, the <hi>Heart</hi> of Love and the like, may ſerve as a <hi>Looking-Glaſs,</hi> wherein beholding thy own Face, thou mayeſt come to know thy ſelf better, both what manner of Perſon thou art, and ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to be; ſo it may ſerve as a <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> whereby true Grace may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that which is counterfeit.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:92979:4"/>
            <p>Now if thy cauſe both concerning Eſtate and Life (all thou hadſt in the World) was trying, wouldſt thou not attend diligently, and with fear and trembling wait for the iſſue, and narrowly obſerve whether the <hi>Verdict,</hi> and <hi>Sentence</hi> was for, or againſt thee? And does it not as much concern thee to be very ſerious, and obſervant about the trial of thy Spiritual and Everlaſting State? Here I would borrow a weighty ſaying of Mr. <hi>Glanvil's,</hi> 
               <q>Meer <hi>Speculative miſtakes</hi> about <hi>Opinions,</hi> do no great hurt: but error in the <hi>Marks,</hi> and <hi>Meaſures</hi> of Religion, is <hi>Deadly.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, if (upon trial) thou findeſt thy ſelf in a Graceleſs ſtate at preſent, yet thou ſhouldeſt not thereupon conclude thy caſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate. So long as the time of God's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is not expired, (<hi>the Long-ſuffering of the Lord is</hi> for our <hi>Salvation</hi>) while the day of Grace laſteth, while the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords any means, continues to make any offer of Grace to thee, thou art yet in a poſsibility of obtaining Saving-Grace; (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:92979:5"/>thy former rejecting, and reſiſting of his Grace.) That as yet thy condition is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether hopeleſs: but rather there is more hope of thy coming on to Saving-Grace, when thou art made truly ſenſible of the want of it.</p>
            <p>Or if (upon Trial) thou findeſt ſome Grace in thee, but very low and weak, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt not to be diſcerned, if it be but in the bud, or but as <hi>ſmoaking Flax,</hi> thy Faith but as <hi>a grain of Muſtard-Seed,</hi> thy Love, thy Zeal but as a ſpark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether thy weakneſs be like that <hi>of a Child,</hi> a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Infant, or like that of <hi>a ſick Man,</hi> one that has loſt his ſtrength by ſome Diſeaſe prevailing on him, how ſhould it humble thee, that thou haſt ſo little Grace? How ſhould it quicken thee to labour after more? And eſpecially if thou haſt declined, if thou haſt <hi>loſt thy firſt Love,</hi> thy former livelineſs, and tenderneſs; Oh, <hi>Repent, and do thy firſt Works!</hi> Now ſtir up the Grace of God in thee, blow up that little ſpark, that is almoſt buried under an heap of Aſhes. Now <hi>ſtrengthen the things that remain,
<pb facs="tcp:92979:5"/>and are ready to die.</hi> Delayes would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thee to further deadneſs, and decayes.</p>
            <p>Or, if thou canſt diſcover Grace in lively and kindly exerciſe in thy Soul, if thou ſeeſt it in growth, and vigour, O how may this heighten thy Joy in the Lord, even raiſe thee to a life of Joy, Praiſe, and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</p>
            <p>But there are two or three things I would lay down here (by way of caution) to prevent Souls miſ-judging themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Let none conclude themſelves in a ſtate of Grace, becauſe they are <hi>in a good mood</hi> ſometimes. Even ſuch as <hi>Pharaoh, Ahab, Herod, Felix, &amp;c.</hi> were in a good mood ſometimes. Learn to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>a good Mood,</hi> and <hi>a Gracious Frame.</hi> We are in God's account (which is the true account) what we are moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, and <hi>habitually</hi> (I mean in reſpect of prevailing habits.) There is no reaſon that God ſhould <hi>take Sinners at beſt,</hi> in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual fit.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Let not any poor trembling Hearts
<pb facs="tcp:92979:6"/>(who are ever forward to ſuſpect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the worſt of themſelves) judg of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the frame of their Spirits, by what they may ſeem in a <hi>Paroxiſm of Temptation.</hi> The beſt upon Earth are not at all times alike. Even eminent Saints have ſometimes bewrayed weakneſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in thoſe very Graces, wherein they were moſt eminent. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was <hi>ſtrong in Faith,</hi> yet ſometimes <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered</hi> through diſtruſt. Meek <hi>Moſes</hi> is once noted (upon a great provocation) to have <hi>ſpoken unadviſedly with his Lips.</hi> And patient <hi>Job</hi> was once heard to <hi>curſe the day of his birth.</hi> But as God takes not Sinners at beſt; ſo neither will he <hi>take</hi> his own Children <hi>at worſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Though all ought to be preſsing after full Perfection in Grace and Holineſs; yet let none look for it here. And though we ſhould have an holy emulation, and deſire to overtake, and if it might be to excel the moſt eminent Chriſtians; yet a poor weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould not conclude he has no Grace,
<pb facs="tcp:92979:6"/>becauſe he hath not ſo much as others. Thou mayst have the <hi>truth of Grace</hi> in thee; tho at preſent thou canſt diſcern little, or no growth. Chriſt's <hi>Family</hi> is made up of Saints of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtature; his <hi>School</hi> conſiſts of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of ſeveral Ranks, and Forms. Some are but <hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> ſome grown Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. There are ſome <hi>little Children,</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; ſome <hi>young Men,</hi> grown up to ſome ſtrength; ſome <hi>Fathers,</hi> old Diſciples, Chriſtians of great ſtanding and experience. Some are but <hi>Novices,</hi> ſome are riper, and <hi>by reaſon of uſe have their Senſes more exerciſed,</hi> and their Graces more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Thou that art but weak, <hi>be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> (what cauſe haſt thou to be humble, when the beſt of Saints, ſuch as far excel thee, have no cauſe to be proud?) Yet <hi>be not thou diſcouraged:</hi> Christ will not <hi>break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoking Flax.</hi> He <hi>will gather the Lambs with his Arm, and carry them in his Boſom, and will gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> And yet
<pb facs="tcp:92979:7"/>out of weakneſs thou mayeſt be made ſtrong. And though thy beginning be but ſmall, thy latter end may greatly encreaſe.</p>
            <p>And further note (touching the ſigns of Grace, I have here laid together) what a
<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> on <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. pag. 188, 189.</note> Learned Man hath; <q>There are three ſorts of <hi>Marks,</hi> ſome are only <hi>excluſive,</hi> others <hi>inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive;</hi> and between theſe a middle ſort of Marks, which he calleth <hi>poſitive. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive</hi> Marks are to ſhut out bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders. The <hi>incluſive</hi> Marks are to ſhew the meaſures and degrees of Grace, and are rather intended for <hi>Comfort,</hi> than for <hi>Conviction:</hi> which if they be found in us, we are ſafe, and in the ſtate of Grace; but if not, we cannot conclude a nullity of Grace. The uſe of theſe Notes is to <hi>comfort,</hi> or to <hi>convince of want of growth.</hi> Again, there is a middle ſort of Marks, which he calleth <hi>poſitive,</hi> and they are ſuch as are <hi>always,</hi> and <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> found in an Heart truly gracious.</q> So
<pb facs="tcp:92979:7"/>he. Theſe poſitive Marks and Signs, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, are fewer; As Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Method for peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Direct.</hi> 11. pag. 88, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See alſo Sermon of <hi>Right Rejoicing,</hi> p. 26, 27.</note> hath laid down five, expreſsing the nature of ſaving Grace, which may be compriſed and <hi>ſummed up</hi> in this one, <hi>ſcil.</hi> A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring God and Chriſt, Grace and Glory, before any way of Sin, before any carnal Self-interest, before all the Honours, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Pleaſures of the World; a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the former, I ſay, in our <hi>practical eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> in our deliberate and <hi>hearty choice,</hi> and in our true, ſerious, and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful endeavours.</hi> Get this one Point well cleared, and then thou mayeſt know thou art one of another Spirit from the Men of the World, a Citizen, and Heir of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And therefore know, I had <hi>no Deſign</hi> in laying down ſo many Notes and Signs of the ſeveral Graces here deſcribed, to ſet weak Chriſtians <hi>on the Rack,</hi> or to encreaſe and multiply their Doubts and Fears. As I have already granted, the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>being of

And I hope, upon a ſerious and deliberate reading, it will not be difficult to obſerve, which are moſt neceſſary, and most ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which eſpecially we are to try our ſelves. But I doubt not, <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> and for fuller ſatisfaction, it may be of great uſe, and advantage to Chriſtians, thus to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the true Nature, ſeveral Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and genuine proper Acts, and Effects of every Grace.</p>
            <p>And thus indeed the Treatiſe may ſerve not only as a guide, in <hi>the trial,</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Grace; but alſo as a <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Directory,</hi> and help to the kindly exerciſe of Grace,</p>
            <p>Now (Reader) if thou art ſerious, <hi>give me thy hand,</hi> and joyn with me in this (I hope I can ſay) hearty requeſt, That <hi>the God of all Grace</hi> would vouchſafe his Bleſsing to accompany it. Which if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, thou mayeſt have an handful of <hi>leaves</hi> here, but no <hi>Fruit.</hi>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:92979:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Now to ſhew, wherein ſound <hi>Spiritual-Knowledg</hi> differeth from other common knowledg.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg differeth from <hi>Natural</hi> Knowledg, as this is a Knowledg of <hi>Natural</hi> things, that of <hi>Spiritual</hi> things. <hi>Natural</hi> Knowledg is the <hi>Knowledg of a Man, Spiritual</hi> Knowledg is the <hi>Knowledg of the Holy,</hi> (Prov. 9.10.) the knowledg of a Saint, or of a Chriſtian. <hi>Natural</hi> Knowledg is a Knowledg of God <hi>in his works,</hi> (Rom. 1.19, 20.) <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg is a Knowledg of God, according as he is revealed in <hi>his Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.169.</p>
               <p>But here you may ſay, Is there not a <hi>Literal Knowledg</hi> of the Word, different from Saving, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Knowledg? <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg differs from a <hi>Literal</hi> Knowledg; as a <hi>Literal</hi> Knowledg doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways infer a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg; though a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Knowledg doth not include the <hi>Literal.</hi> A <hi>Literal</hi> Knowledg is from a <hi>common</hi> illumination, <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg from a <hi>ſpecial</hi> Illumination of the Spirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Docet modum nempe per revelatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Sacrarum Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum, quae fit tollen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do velum è cordibus noſtris, &amp; illuſtrando mentes noſtras, quò</hi> &amp;c. <hi>De Revelatione hîc loquitur, non quae Prophetis ſpeciali mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſiebat, ſed quae om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus piis communis eſt.</hi> M. Pol. è Zanch. in Eph. p. 31. c. b.</note> Not that it is by <hi>immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (as the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was made known to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſtles.) Nor do Divines intend ſuch <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, when they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt <hi>Literal</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as betwixt an <hi>acquired</hi> Habit, and an Habit <hi>infuſed:</hi> But this is by a <hi>ſpecial,</hi> powerful irradiation, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the Underſtanding,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:92979:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>lightning, and raiſing it to a <hi>Spiritual</hi> diſcerning of the Myſtery, and method of Salvation, <hi>revealed in the Word,</hi> which a Man had but a ſlighty, overly Knowledg of before. 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Though by ſuch means as Reading, Hearing, Study, Conference, he may come to a <hi>notional</hi> literal Knowledg of the Scriptures, and of the Doctrine of Chriſt; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>ſpecial</hi> work of the Spirit, a Man cannot <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually</hi> diſcern the ſame. Take a <hi>Natural Man,</hi> that knows moſt of the things of God, that can diſcourſe well of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and other Points in Divinity; yet they are <hi>ſtrange things</hi> to him, he ſees them, but as things <hi>afar off;</hi> yea blindneſs of Mind, in a prevailing degree, ſtill hinders him from paſſing a right practical Judgment of the ſurpaſſing worth and excellency of Spiritual things, till he comes to this enlightning of the Spirit. And one that is thus enlightned, can ſay (as he, Joh. 9.25.) <hi>whereas I was blind, now I ſee.</hi> He hath other thoughts of Sin, than he had before: he hath other thoughts of God and Chriſt, of Heaven and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than he had before.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Spiritual Knowledg is not ordinarily attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>without means;</hi> and when it is attained, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtill to attend humbly, and diligently on the means God hath appointed.</p>
               <p>The more <hi>common works</hi> of the Spirit prepare for the <hi>ſpecial works</hi> of the Spirit. So a common Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Knowledg makes way for <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg. Certainly, it is not the ordinary way and method of the Spirit, to dart in the Saving Knowledg of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:92979:11"/>God and Chriſt <hi>immediately</hi> into Souls, that knew nothing of God and Chriſt before. But thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths, which we had but a dim and ſlighty apprehenſion of, he ſheweth with fuller and plainer evidence. And as the Lord hath enjoyned us the uſe of the means, to attain to Knowledg, Men have no ground to hope they ſhould come to Knowledg in the neglect of means. <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.</hi> Hoſ. 6.3.</p>
               <p>We are not now to look for <hi>immediate</hi> Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but to hear what the Word ſaith, which was given by Divine Inſpiration. What the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>the Spirit ſaith. Heb.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. We are to wait on the Spirit, not to give us <hi>new Scriptures,</hi> but to <hi>open our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures,</hi> which he hath already given. We are to Read, Hear, Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we may underſtand.</p>
               <p>They that wholly neglect and deſpiſe the means of Knowledg, that will not go <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony,</hi> that ſeek not the Law at the Mouths of God's Meſſengers (whoſe Lips ſhould preſerve Knowledg) but <hi>deſpiſe propheſying,</hi> conceiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſer than their Teachers: And they that would be Wiſe and knowing, beſides, and <hi>above that which is written,</hi> and ſet up, cry up <hi>the Light within</hi> (as they ſpeak) above the written Word, how much ſoever they are conceited of their own Knowledg, ſhould know, that it cannot be ſound. Such as exalt their Wiſdom againſt the Wiſdom of God in his Word, contemning the means he hath appointed, are preſumptuous indeed, and <hi>Proud, knowing nothing, as they ought to know.</hi> Such are not taught, <hi>as the Holy Ghoſt teacheth,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:92979:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>be their pretences to the Spirit never ſo high.</p>
               <p>To <hi>receive Wiſdom's words,</hi> to incline our Ears, and apply our Hearts thereto, to <hi>cry after Knowledg,</hi> and lift up our Voice for Underſtanding, to ſeek her as Silver, and dig for her, as for hid treaſures, this is the way indeed to <hi>find the Knowledg of God,</hi> Prov. 2.1, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Spiritual Knowledg is clear, and ſatisfying. True it is, that all who have the <hi>ſpecial</hi> Illumination of the Spirit, have not the <hi>ſame degree</hi> and meaſure of Knowledg, but <hi>recipitur ad modum recipientis.</hi> Some Chriſtians are but <hi>Babes,</hi> not <hi>Men of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</hi> And we all <hi>know but in part,</hi> and ſee but darkly compared with the Saints in Heaven. Yet where God <hi>hath ſhined into the Hearts of any, to give the Light of the Knowledg of his Glory, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Such muſt needs have a more <hi>firm</hi> and certain aſſent to the Truth, than they, who are in a ſtate of Darkneſs. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, Joh. 6.69. <hi>We believe, and are ſure,</hi> that thou art that Chriſt the Son of the Living God. As Chriſt of the Diſciples, Joh. 17.8. They have received my Words, and have <hi>known ſurely,</hi> that I came out from thee. As the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14. <hi>I know, and am perſwaded.</hi> As the Goſpel came to the believing Theſſalonians <hi>not in Word only, but alſo in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much Aſſurance,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknowledgment</hi> of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. As Divines diſtinguiſh <hi>inter cognitionem &amp; agnitionem,</hi> betwixt bare knowing, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth. That <hi>of the Head</hi> only, this of <hi>the Heart</hi> alſo: that overly, and ſuperficial; this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:92979:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>deep, and thorow. As the Apoſtle prayeth here, that they might be filled with the Knowledg of God's Will, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (the word here uſed) is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>cumulata &amp; alta cognitio,</hi> a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorowly, a deep apprehenſion of the Truth. Many have the Truth lying looſe on their Minds, have only fleeting, wavering apprehenſions of it: Whereas it is deeply impreſſed on the Minds of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. And though they may not have ſo much <hi>notional</hi> Knowledg as others have; yet they have not a bare Knowledg, but are come to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Truth, not a meer <hi>verbal,</hi> but a <hi>real</hi> hearty acknowledgment, at leaſt of all Truth abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation. And <hi>as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing hath taught them, they ſhall abide in it,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27.</p>
               <p>Now, are we come to <hi>know the certainty of thoſe things, wherein we have been inſtructed?</hi> Do we ſee Spiritual things to be as great <hi>realities,</hi> as are in the World? Or, are we ſtill <hi>halting between two opinions,</hi> and but <hi>almoſt perſwaded</hi> of the Truth of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Are our Minds hovering, and in ſuſpence, thinking theſe things may be true, or they may be falſe? Though a Man be able to diſcourſe Learnedly, and Orthodoxly, of the evil of Sin, and a Sinners Miſery without Chriſt, of Chriſt and his Benefits, and the way to be intereſted in him; of the Day of Judgment, Heaven, and Hell; that there is a place and ſtate of everlaſting Happineſs, prepared for the Righteous; and there is a place, and ſtate of endleſs Miſery, for all that are finally impenitent, and Unbelievers; if yet he has come to no <hi>certain concluſion</hi> with himſelf about theſe matters (he durſt not venture all he hath in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:92979:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>World upon the Truth of theſe things) ſurely it is but <hi>opinion</hi> that ſuch a one taketh up withal, it deſerveth not the name of <hi>Knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Sound <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg is powerfully <hi>affecting.</hi> By this we are not only reſolved in our Judgments, but <hi>reſolved in our choice.</hi> A good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding will <hi>chuſe the better part,</hi> is for cleaving to that which is good. So <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> are joyned here. And <hi>the wiſdom of the Prudent is to underſtand his way,</hi> Prov. 14.8. Spiritual Knowledg will teach one to <hi>approve things that are excellent,</hi> Phil. 1.9, 10.</p>
               <p>A meer Notional <hi>Speculative</hi> Knowledg is of no effect, it leaveth the Will undetermined. And let a Man know never ſo much in Religion, if it be meerly <hi>ſpeculatively,</hi> not <hi>practically,</hi> it is in effect as if he knew nothing. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.28. They are a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>void of Counſel, neither is there any underſtanding in them.</hi> Hence the Scripture calleth all wicked Men <hi>Fools.</hi> So Chriſt calleth the Phariſees <hi>Blind</hi> (though many of them were knowing.) Their Knowledg being without effect, it was as if they had none. And can there be any greater <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> in the World, than for Men to prefer Worldly Pleaſures, Riches, Honours, before an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and the Favour of God, and the Fruition of him; to prefer Fading Lying Vanities, before endleſs Joys, enduring Subſtance, and a never-fading Crown of Glory? to chuſe Sin, Hell and Everlaſting Deſtruction, before Righteouſneſs, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Eternal Happineſs? If this be not ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Folly, tell me what is?</p>
               <p>As there is a <hi>form of Godlineſs, without the Power</hi> (2 Tim. 3.5.) So there is a <hi>form of Knowledg</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:92979:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>(Rom. 2.20.) without the Power. <hi>Notional</hi> Knowledg is weak indeed: but <hi>Spiritual</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that is powerful. As they ſaid, Act. 4.20. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard:</hi> So we cannot but be affected with the great things God makes known to us by his Word and Spirit.

               <p n="6">(6.) Spiritual Knowledg is <hi>renewing.</hi> Col. 3.10. And have put on the new Man, which <hi>is renewed in Knowledg.</hi> It is <hi>Non modo Lux, ſed ſanitas quaedam &amp; integritas Animae.</hi> It is not a Light in the Mind, but the ſoundneſs of the Mind. It is not only <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting,</hi> but <hi>rectifying;</hi> not barely <hi>enforming,</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> and <hi>transforming.</hi> It is true, that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which is not Saving, may make a great change in the lives of ſome. As we read of ſome Apoſtates, that had <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the World through the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:92979:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>Knowledg of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. But <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg (that which is an effect of <hi>ſpecial</hi> Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) is an <hi>Introduction</hi> to <hi>Spiritual Renovation,</hi> to an inward thorow change. It not only brings <hi>Conviction,</hi> but is attended with <hi>Converſion.</hi> There is a <hi>turning from Iniquity,</hi> with this <hi>underſtanding of the Truth,</hi> Dan. 9.13. And a <hi>coming</hi> in to Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. Every Man therefore that hath heard, and hath <hi>learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> So the Spirit <hi>guideth</hi> thoſe to whom he is given, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Truth, but into Truth, <hi>into all</hi> (neceſſary) Truth, Joh. 16.13. An Emphatical Expreſſion. <hi>Tò docere, terminatur in intellectu: Sed ducere &amp;c. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet ad voluntatem &amp; affectum.</hi> The Truth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally apprehended makes a Spiritual Impreſſion on the Soul. The Heart is new caſt into the form and Mould of Divine Truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. Thus Sound Knowledg <hi>makes ſound. Spiritual</hi> Knowledg ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a <hi>Spiritual Man.</hi> As the Fear of the Lord (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Word, that teacheth his Fear) is clean, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.9. It is ſo, not only <hi>formalitèr,</hi> but <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivè,</hi> pure in it ſelf, and a cauſe of Purity. Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Knowledg will make a Man ſpiritually minded. And this is a grand difference betwixt <hi>Notional</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg. The former doth ſomething enlighten, but not ſanctify: but the latter is alſo <hi>Sanctifying,</hi> Joh. 17.17. <hi>Sanctify them through thy Truth.</hi> Certainly, that Knowledg of the Truth is not <hi>Saving,</hi> which is not <hi>Sanctifying:</hi> Nor is our Knowledg ſanctified, if we are not ſanctifyed by it.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) Spiritual Knowledg is humbling. Sound Knowledg does not <hi>puff up,</hi> ſo as other Knowledg does. 1 Cor. 8.1, 2. <hi>If any Man ſeemeth to himſelf
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:92979:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>to know any thing,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> is lifted up with proud and high conceits of himſelf in regard of his Knowledg) <hi>he knoweth nothing</hi> yet <hi>as he ought to know.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it to be the Apoſtles meaning here to commend <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> or a doubting of every thing in Religion; or to commend a <hi>fained Modeſty,</hi> or denying the Knowledg God hath given us; or to condemn <hi>Knowledg:</hi> but indeed to condemn <hi>Pride,</hi> in the opinion, or conceit of our Knowledg. There is a <hi>Woe</hi> to thoſe, that <hi>are wiſe in their own Eyes,</hi> Iſa. 5.21. True <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Lowlineſs</hi> go together. Prov. 11.2. <hi>With the Lowly is Wiſdom.</hi> And Wiſdom and Spiritual Underſtanding go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Indeed Sound <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg would take down the ſwellings of Pride. Pride cannot <hi>reign,</hi> where Sound Knowledg <hi>dwelleth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Spiritual Knowledg cannot be without a Sound <hi>Knowledg of God.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Igitur ignorantes quique Deum, rem quoque ejus ignorent nec eſſe eſt.</hi> Tertul. <hi>de Poenitentia.</hi>
                  </note> And the more we know of God, the more we ſhall ſee cauſe to be humbled in our ſelves. As holy <hi>Job,</hi> the more he ſaw of God, the more he was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Again, Spiritual Knowledg cannot be without a <hi>Knowledg of our ſelves.</hi> And when the Spirit enlightneth Sinners, one of his <hi>firſt works</hi> is to <hi>convince of Sin,</hi> Joh. 16.8. Now certainly they that are lifted up in themſelves, know little of themſelves. They that are thorowly convinced of Sin, and come to know themſelves aright, cannot but have low thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:92979:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Again, Spiritual Knowledg is not without the <hi>Knowledg of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cui enem veritas comperta ſine Deo, cui Deus cognitus ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Chriſto, cui Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus exploratus ſine Spiritu Sancto?</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. <hi>de Anima.</hi>
                  </note> (the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediator betwixt God and Man.) Now the Knowledg of Chriſt leads us out of our ſelves, makes us appear to be worſe than nothing in and of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Again, Let me add this; even they that are <hi>beſt learn'd</hi> in the <hi>School of Chriſt,</hi> cannot but be ſenſible that they know but <hi>in part,</hi> that they are very defective herein. Chriſt's Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars the further they learn, the more they perceive their own I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>norance and Shallowneſs. <hi>O the depths</hi> in Divinity! How ſhort are our Conceptions! How many Myſteries here that we are not able to dive into, or fathom?
<note n="†" place="margin">Maxima pars corum quae ſcimus est minima pars corum, quae neſcimus.</note> All we know is but little, to what we know not. It is the <hi>Novice</hi> in Religion, that is in moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being <hi>lifted up with Pride,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.6. While ſuch as know little are too often <hi>wiſe in their own conceits,</hi> they that have made great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proficiency, cannot but charge themſelves with folly. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16, 22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) Spiritual Knowledg is <hi>nouriſhing.</hi> As the Lord promiſeth, that his People ſhould be <hi>fed with Knowledg and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Jer. 3.15. As ſome have noted <hi>[with Knowledg and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding]</hi> there, may not only reſpect <hi>modum paſcendi,</hi> the manner how their Teachers ſhould feed them (<hi>ſcil.</hi> underſtandingly and prudently) but alſo <hi>materiam paſtûs,</hi> the matter of their Food, the ſound Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God's Word. This is nouriſhing. There's
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:92979:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Heart</hi> in it. As <hi>Timothy</hi> was <hi>nouriſhed up in the Words of Faith, and of good Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.6. As the Word of God is compared to <hi>Milk,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. Indeed there is both <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>ſtrong Meat,</hi> Heb. 5.12. It is <hi>pabulum Animae.</hi> The Spiritual Knowledg of God and his Word does Souls good indeed. It is as <hi>Food</hi> to the Graces of the Spirit, as <hi>Fuel</hi> to holy Affections. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 2 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Grace be multiplyed unto you, through the Knowledg of God, and of Jeſus our Lord.</hi> And in his concluding exhortation, <hi>to grow in Grace,</hi> chap. 3.18. he addeth [and <hi>in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi>] as a means ſpecially conducing to their growth in Grace.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed you even now, that <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg is a great promoter of <hi>Humility.</hi> So doth it further on <hi>Repentance.</hi> As that expreſſion of a Mans <hi>knowing the Plague of his own Heart,</hi> 1 King. 8.38. may ſhew. There is no Repentance, without knowing the Plague of ones own Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg is both an In-let, and a ſtay and help to <hi>Faith,</hi> and truſt in God. Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> So <hi>Knowledg</hi> is put for <hi>Faith,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. <hi>By his Knowledg</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> by the Knowledg of himſelf) ſhall my righteous Servant juſtify many. So it begets, and maintains the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of Knowledg,</hi> and of the <hi>Fear of the Lord,</hi> go together, Iſa. 11.2. Prov. 2.3, 5. If thou cryeſt after <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> — then ſhalt thou <hi>underſtand the Fear of the Lord.</hi> And if thou knoweſt God aright, ſurely thou wilt reverence him, thou wilt fear before him, thou wilt ſtand in awe of him, fear to offend him. Again, this is ever a Friend to <hi>the Love of God.</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:92979:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>Pſal. 91.14. Becauſe he hath <hi>ſet his Love</hi> upon me — becauſe he hath <hi>known my name.</hi> They that know his Name will ſet their Love on him. How great is his Goodneſs, and how great is his Beauty? If we know him aright, we cannot but admire him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. I will give them <hi>an Heart to know me,</hi> that I am the Lord] not only an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> but an <hi>Heart</hi> to know me. They ſhall know me, ſo as to love, own and cleave to me. It follows [and <hi>they ſhall be my People,</hi> and I will be their God.] That this Promiſe <hi>[I will give them an Heart to know me]</hi> ſeemeth to be the ſame in ſenſe with that Deut. 30.6. <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine Heart, to love the Lord thy God.</hi> The Spiritual Knowledg of God hath both <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> in it. It warmeth, it enflameth the Heart with love to him. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Phil. 1.9, 10. Pſal. 36.10. O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy loving-kindneſs to them <hi>that know thee:</hi> and thy Righteouſneſs to the <hi>upright in Heart.</hi> Here they that know God, and the upright in Heart, are the ſame Perſons. They that know God aright, would dread to think of mocking God in Religion, would fear to <hi>play the Deceivers.</hi> Would not God ſearch this out? for he knoweth the ſecrets of the Heart.</p>
               <p>Thus Spiritual Knowledg is ſound indeed. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional-Knowledg is windy, and airy. Men may have their <hi>Heads ſwelled</hi> with it: but that's all. Their Hearts are not bettered by it. As Meat that lyeth on the Stomack undigeſted, is more noxious, than nouriſhing, it breedeth ill Humours: a meer ſpeculative Knowledg is like Food that digeſts not. I remember it is <hi>Bernard's</hi> compariſon.</p>
               <p n="9">(9.) Spiritual Knowledg is <hi>fruitful.</hi> Good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:92979:16"/>is like <hi>good Seed.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſays of the Word here, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. It <hi>bringeth forth Fruit</hi> in you, ſince the day ye heard it, and <hi>knew the Grace of God in Truth.</hi> It brings forth the Fruits of Repentance and Reformation. Pſal. 119.104. <hi>Through thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts I get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: therefore I hate every falſe way.</hi> Job 28.28. <hi>The fear of the Lord, this is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and to depart from evil, is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> And the fruit of Obedience. Pſal. 111.10. <hi>A good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have all they that do his Commandments.</hi> Deut. 4.6. <hi>Keep my Statutes,</hi> and do them; for <hi>this is your Wiſdom, and your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.3, 4. <hi>Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. He that ſaith, I know him, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Commandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</hi> The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that is <hi>from above</hi> is full <hi>of good Fruits,</hi> Jam. 3.17. The believing <hi>Romans</hi> were <hi>full of Goodneſs, filled with Knowledg.</hi> Rom. 15.14. So the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> here, that they might be <hi>filled with the Knowledg of God's Will— that they might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in the Knowledg of God,</hi> ver. 10. Thus, Who is a wiſe Man and <hi>endued with Knowledg</hi> among you? let <hi>him ſhew out</hi> of a <hi>good Converſation his Works</hi> with Meekneſs of Wiſdom, Jam. 3.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Notional</hi> Knowledg is vain and idle, barren and unfruitful: <hi>Spiritual</hi> Knowledg is operative, and practical. Let us know never ſo much, if our Knowledg be not ſincerely, and faithfully reduced into Practice, it will aggravate both our Sin, and our <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">(10.) Spiritual-Knowledg is <hi>Communicative.</hi> Prov. 15.2. The Tongue of the Wiſe <hi>uſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:92979:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>aright.</hi> Others make no uſe of their Knowledg, or not a right uſe. Some would know only to know, which is meer <hi>curioſity;</hi> Some would know to make themſelves known,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bern. in Caiit.</hi> Ser. 36.</note> which is <hi>Pride,</hi> and Vanity: the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Man is for Knowledg to regulate his own Life and Practice, and to edify and profit others, and this is <hi>Spiritual Wiſdom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">R. Boulton.</note> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which (as one ſays) <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> is but a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> or <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſan,</hi> kept only for ſenſual Pleaſure, not for Fruit, and Children. As Light is diffuſive, Spiritual Knowledg is Communicative. Such as have it, would have others better for what they know. Dan. 11.33. <hi>They that underſtand among the People, ſhall inſtruct many.</hi> Prov. 10.21. The Lips of the Righteous <hi>feed many.</hi> Prov. 12.18. <hi>The Tongue of the Wiſe is Health.</hi> Some carry Poyſon in their Tongues; and their Breath is infectious. But the <hi>Tongue of the wiſe is Health. The Lips of the Wiſe diſperſe Knowledg,</hi> Prov. 15.7. They feed many. Though all are not Teachers <hi>by Office,</hi> yet <hi>in a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative way</hi> it is both their Duty and Deſire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and admoniſh others, Neighbours, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that they have opportunity of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with. As the Apoſtle ſays of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 14.— <hi>filled with Knowledg, able alſo to admoniſh one another.</hi> And eſpecially would the Lips of ſuch feed thoſe who are under their ſpecial charge: They would not that any under their charge, ſhould ſtarve and <hi>periſh for lack of Knowledg.</hi> If we are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God and Jeſus Chriſt, we cannot but be ſenſible of the Miſery of thoſe, who yet remain
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:92979:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>Strangers to him. We ſhall pitty them. And we ſhall endeavour eſpecially to acquaint ours with him.</p>
               <p>Some indeed may be forward to put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to ſhew their Gifts, and Parts, when they have no deſign to help others forward. They that aim at their <hi>own Praiſe,</hi> not at others <hi>Profit,</hi> may have that Knowledg which puffeth up: but Saving Knowledg, that which is accompanied with true Grace, is for <hi>edifying.</hi> (1 Cor. 8.1.)</p>
               <p n="11">(11.) Spiritual-Knowledg is <hi>growing:</hi> How growing? Not in empty Notions, not in nice, and curious <hi>Speculations:</hi> but in more intimacy with ſound and <hi>practical Truths,</hi> and in ſolid <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Heart of him that hath <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, ſeeketh Knowledg,</hi> Prov. 15.14. The <hi>Knowledg of Wiſdom is ſweet to the Soul, when it is found;</hi> Sweet as Honey, and the Honey-comb (Prov. 24.13, 14.) The Soul that hath a taſte of it, will deſire more. And <hi>Knowledg is eaſy unto him that underſtandeth,</hi> Prov. 14.6. It is more eaſily increaſed, than at firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Every prudent Man <hi>dealeth with Knowledg,</hi> Prov. 13.16. Knowledg is a Commodity he deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with, and <hi>will deal</hi> with. The word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is in the <hi>future tenſe,</hi> noting a continued Act. Wiſe Men <hi>lay up Knowledg,</hi> Prov. 10.14. We heard before, that their Lips <hi>diſperſe Knowledg.</hi> So they are ever and anon <hi>laying out.</hi> But it is their care as well to lay in, <hi>to lay up</hi> Knowledg. They will be ſtoring up more and more of this Treaſure, which indeed is not leſſened by a ſeaſonable laying out.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we think of thoſe that deſpiſe the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:92979:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>means of Knowledg. <hi>A wiſe Man will hear, and will increaſe learning,</hi> Prov. 1.5. They that are not for learning in God's way, ſure, they are not wiſe: they that ſay they know as much as Miniſters can teach them, they that think, they know enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, their Knowledg is not ſound. Indeed their <hi>Pride,</hi> and fooliſh Self-conceit is more than their <hi>Knowledg.</hi>

               <p n="1">(1.) Spiritual Minds are for knowing more of <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi> This Knowledg is moſt neceſſary, and moſt excellent. This is <hi>Life eternal,</hi> Joh. 17.3.

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:92979:18"/>Phil. 3.8.

How are Angels taken with it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. How pleaſant is this Light to all Sound Minds!</p>
               <p>Yea, Spiritual Minds are not only for more Knowledg of God and Jeſus Chriſt, as revealed in the Scripture: but for an <hi>experimental Knowledg</hi> of him, in his <hi>ſpecial works</hi> of Grace on them. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of God's <hi>revealing his Son in him,</hi> Gal. 1.16.

The more they know of God, the more earneſtly they deſire, and endeavour to diſcover their <hi>ſpecial propriety</hi> in God.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:92979:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>They cannot be ſatisfyed, till they know him to be <hi>their God.</hi> The more they know of Jeſus Chriſt, the more they long to know that he is <hi>their Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>their Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Spiritual Minds are for knowing more of themſelves. There can be no Sound Knowledg without Self-Knowledg. <hi>Nil proſunt lecta nec intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecta, niſi teipſum legas &amp; intelligas.</hi> Let a Man Read, Study, Underſtand never-ſo-much, all his Knowledg is vain, and unprofitable, without an application of it to himſelf. Job. 5.27. <hi>Hear, and know thou it for thy good.</hi> In the Hebrew, it is, know thou <hi>for thy ſelf,</hi> or <hi>with thy ſelf.</hi> Many hear as for others, are more ready to apply the Word to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers than to themſelves. Such are not likely to get good by what they hear, are no better for what they know. The Word is compared to <hi>a Glaſs.</hi> And it concerneth every one, to <hi>look</hi> his Face in this <hi>Glaſs.</hi> Yea, it is not enough to look with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Glance, and ſo away again: but we muſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein,</hi> to know what manner of Perſons we are, and ought to be, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.23, 24, 25. And Spiritual Minds are for Self-Acquaintance. Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Knowledg will put Souls upon, and help in examining, and proving themſelves, that they may know themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Spiritual Minds would know <hi>all the Counſel of God,</hi> ſo far as concerneth them: and eſpecially they are for knowing what moſt nearly concerneth them. <q>Knowledg without Wiſdom (as one ſays) is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually <hi>curious,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Sound Minds would be acquainted with the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:92979:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>Word of God, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con.</hi> They are ready to receive it, whether it make for them, or againſt them. And ſo, <hi>The Ear that heareth the reproof of Life, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth among the Wiſe. He that heareth reproof getteth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Prov. 15.31, 32. See alſo Prov. 19.25. What a ſtrict charge did <hi>Eli</hi> lay on <hi>Samuel,</hi> not to <hi>hide any thing from him, that the Lord had told him,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.17. And when he was told of the evil determined againſt his Houſe, he did not fret and fume; but ſaid <hi>[It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.]</hi> So <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 King. 20.19. But how few that would like to hear of their Sins, or are willing to hear of the Judgments God has denounced againſt them in his Word? Such Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is too painful for the moſt. They had rather ſleep on in their Sins, than be ſo diſquieted. God's Meſſengers are accounted their Enemies, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, when they tell them the Truth. Alas, we can meet with but few in compariſon, that are for <hi>right things,</hi> that will endure ſharp reproof (though needful to ſet them Sound.) But few that would have their Sores touch'd. But a Sound Mind would hear, and know the worſt of it ſelf. It is the Prayer of ſuch a one, <hi>Make me to know my Transgreſſion, and my Sin. What I ſee not, teach thou me; and wherein I have done Iniquity,</hi> I would do ſo no more. <hi>Search me, O God, and prove me; and ſee if there be any way of Wickedneſs in me,</hi> and lead me in the Way Everlaſting. Such would know their Sins, to be humbled for them, and to turn from them.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe Sound Minds would know more of their Duty, to diſcharge it. Theſe would be more knowing, not only in <hi>matters of Faith;</hi> but as well in <hi>matters of Practice.</hi> Prov. 10.8. The Wiſe in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:92979:19"/>Heart will <hi>receive Commandments.</hi> The Wiſdom of the Prudent is to <hi>underſtand his way.</hi> In the point of his Duty here he would not be to ſeek. Such have little time to ſpend, have little Heart to ſpend time, about ſuch Notions (though true) that have little, or no influence on the Heart and Life. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtudy thoſe things moſt, that do leaſt concern them: And are taken up with <hi>by-matters,</hi> neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>main.</hi> But <hi>wholſom words,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Godlineſs agree beſt with <hi>Sound Minds.</hi> As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, Pſal. 119.104. <hi>Through thy Precepts I get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> And prayeth, ver. 27. <hi>Make me to underſtand the way of thy Precepts.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ver. 73. <hi>Give me <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that I may learn thy Commandments.</hi> As <hi>John's</hi> hearers, came, and asked, <hi>What ſhall we do? What ſhall we do?</hi> Luk. 3.10, 12, 14. Serious Minds make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Knowledg, which hath no influence on, is not reducible to practice.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord grant, that we may be <hi>filled with the Knowledg of his will, in all Wiſdom, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> that we may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work, and encreaſing in the Knowledg of God.</p>

               <p>SAving <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>omnium virtutum radix &amp; Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum,</hi> as the <hi>Foundation</hi> in the Spiritual Building, as the <hi>root</hi> of other Graces.

A Chriſtian could not live without it, nor can he <hi>periſh</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is, How <hi>Saving-Faith</hi> may be known? And wherein it is differenced from other Faith that is not Saving?</p>
               <p>Indeed there is an <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> or <hi>Dogmatical Faith,</hi> and there is a <hi>practical</hi> Faith; there is a <hi>dead</hi> Faith, and a <hi>living</hi> Faith; there is a <hi>temporary</hi> Faith, and a grounded and <hi>permanent</hi> Faith; there is a <hi>counterfeit</hi> Faith, and <hi>unfeigned</hi> Faith. It ought to be our great care, that we take not <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rachel,</hi> that we take not up with a <hi>Fancy</hi> inſtead of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt I ſhall ſhew, what it is not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. True Faith is not a <hi>blind, implicite Aſſent,</hi> to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:92979:20"/>one knows not what. Not <hi>a believing as the Church believes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant, as there is a <hi>general Repentance,</hi> and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; ſo a <hi>general Faith.</hi> As there is an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> for <hi>unknown</hi> Sins, when a Man is humbled, and heartily grieved to think, that he is more vile and ſinful, than he ſees himſelf to be; and to think that he is guilty of a multitude of Sins more than he is able to find out, and diſcover in his Heart, and Life; whereby he is <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to a <hi>particular</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for any of thoſe unknown Sins, as he cometh to a knowledg of them: ſo there is a <hi>general,</hi> and <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> or Aſſent to Divine Truths, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in God's Word, ſuch as one hath not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the knowledg of; when a Man believeth that whatſoever God ſaith in his Word is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, and would yeild his Aſſent readily to any Truth, which at preſent he has no knowledg of, as ſoon as he ſees the Scripture for it.</p>
               <p>But this general, <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> and <hi>credence of the Word</hi> of God, is quite different from that <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith,</hi> and credence of the <hi>Churches Teſtimony,</hi> which ſome Popiſh Doctors ſo much commend. And that this is not true Faith, is very plain and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. For 1. The <hi>Popiſh implicite Faith</hi> is but the belief of an <hi>humane Teſtimony.</hi> And can that be a Divine Faith, which reſteth on an humane Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It prepares Men for receiving and drinking in abundance of Errors, contrary to the Word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Sound Faith. They muſt <hi>believe as the Church believeth,</hi> and therefore may not queſtion, much leſs deny any thing the Church holdeth, how contrary ſoever to the word of Truth.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:92979:21"/>
               <p n="3">3. It foſtereth a Multitude of their poor deluded People in moſt lamentable Ignorance. Yea, indeed it ſeemeth to have been deviſed, to <hi>put out Mens Eyes,</hi> that ſo they might lead them even which way they pleaſe. Notwithſtanding many of their Writers cannot but grant, that this <hi>implicite</hi> Faith hath no place about the <hi>neceſſary Articles</hi> of Faith: but that theſe muſt be <hi>explicitely</hi> believed. Only they ſay, it is ſufficient for the common People to believe with an <hi>implicite Faith</hi> thoſe points, which are beſides the <hi>neceſſary Articles</hi> of Faith; yet it is famouſly known, that the <hi>Ruling part</hi> of their Church have even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the common People the uſe of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their own Tongue, where they well could, and have been alſo for impoſing on them Service in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> whereby People commonly underſtand not either what is ſaid by the Prieſt, or what themſelves ſay. Of which Sr.
<note place="margin">Europae Speculum (Quarto.) <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Edwyn Sandys</hi> ſayes well; <q>Their Service is no other than as a <hi>Lamp put out,</hi> which bringeth no <hi>Light</hi> at all to the Underſtanding, nor can bring any <hi>due warmth</hi> to the Affection.</q> And thus notwithſtanding the fair <hi>Comment</hi> that ſome of their Doctors, School-men, and Caſuiſts put upon their <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> their common practice would teach us to take it in a worſe ſenſe, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> as an <hi>Engine</hi> contrived to keep People in Ignorance, and in <hi>blind Obedience,</hi> and faſt ſubjection to their Prelates.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a great Abſurdity. Their Implicite Faith is <hi>no Faith:</hi> but a meer Cloak for Ignorance. As

               </p>
               <p>What rare learned Doctrine was that of <hi>Altenſtaig,</hi> That an <hi>implicite Faith</hi> availeth ſo much,
<note place="margin">Dictionar. in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo [credere.]</note> that if any one having it ſhould think falſly (moved with his natural reaſon) that the Father was greater than, or before the Son, or that the three Perſons were locally diſtant from one another, or the like; yet he is not an <hi>Heretick,</hi> he ſinneth not, whilſt that he doth not pertinaciouſly defend his errour, and believeth this becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth the Church doth ſo believe. What a <hi>rare device</hi> is this, that would keep an <hi>Arrian,</hi> a <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> an <hi>Audian</hi> or <hi>Anthropomorphite</hi> from being an Heretick? But how abſurd is it, to hold, that a Man believeth, <hi>Non tantum qui actu, ut loquuntur, non aſſentit:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Panſtr. <hi>tom.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 377. §. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſed etiam qui actu diſſentit,</hi> (as learned <hi>Chamier</hi> notes) who not only doth not actually aſſent, but alſo actually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth? But enough of that.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) True Saving-Faith is not a bare <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> or <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> quarrel with the term <hi>[Hiſtorical.]</hi> But by <hi>Hiſtorical Faith</hi> our Divines do not mean a Faith confined to the <hi>Hiſtorical part</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but ſuch a Faith which (though it taketh in the whole Word of God for its object, yet) aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no otherwiſe unto it, than as a Man may give credit to an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of things, that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth him. This <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> or <hi>Dogmatical
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:92979:22"/>Faith,</hi> (which is their <hi>Fides informis,</hi> formleſs Faith) they hold to be one and the ſame with the Faith which is Juſtifying and Saving. That <hi>Faith,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be joyned with or ſeparated from <hi>Charity,</hi> hath all that is eſſential to Faith: only the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Charity</hi> with Faith makes it Living, and Saving. But if <hi>Hiſtorical Faith</hi> was the ſame with <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theſ. Theol. <hi>(in Folio.) p.</hi> 3. §. 11. &amp; vid. §. 12.</note> then whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had Hiſtorical Faith, <hi>hoc ipſo,</hi> he ſhould have Juſtifying Faith, as <hi>Le Blanc</hi> argues.</p>
               <p>And then all that have <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> having all that is eſſential to Faith, ſhould be ſaved. For <hi>he that believeth, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The <hi>Scripture cannot be broken,</hi> which hath entailed Salvation upon all true Believers. Either <hi>Faith</hi> neceſſarily includeth more than a bare Aſſent to the Truth, or all that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Truth are ſaved.</p>
               <p>Indeed we have ſome, that hold <hi>Faith</hi> to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the underſtanding, a giving credit to the Word of God, as true. As, to believe a thing, is to <hi>aſſent</hi> to the truth of a Propoſition, for the Authority and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of him that ſpeaks it. And this they would confirm by Scripture. As that Text is urged, Joh. 11.26, 27. <q>In which words (ſays one) we ſee,
<note place="margin">Hobs <hi>Philoſoph. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</hi> c. 18 p. 349.</note> that the Queſtion <hi>[Believeſt thou in me?]</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Anſwer <hi>[Thou art the Chriſt.]</hi> To <hi>believe in</hi> Chriſt therefore is nothing elſe, but to <hi>believe Jeſus</hi> himſelf ſaying, that <hi>he is the Chriſt.</hi>
                  </q> So Mat. 16.16. and 1 Joh. 4.2. is likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged here.</p>
               <p>But it is certain, the Scripture doth not take the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:92979:22"/>words [<hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Believing,</hi>] in ſo <hi>ſtrict</hi> a ſenſe, as a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> would take them: but more <hi>largely.</hi> And ſo (as others have noted) the expreſſions alledged are not to be taken <hi>excluſive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Ames Medul. c. 3. §. 20. <hi>Shepherd Sound Believer.</hi> p. 159, 160.</note> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive,</hi> not as excluding other <hi>Acts of Faith</hi> which other Texts of Scripture <hi>expreſſively</hi> attribute unto it; but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, and ſuppoſing them. And there was a <hi>ſpecial reaſon,</hi> why <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould be deſcribed then, as a <hi>believing that Jeſus was the Chriſt,</hi> the Son of the Living God, and a believing that Jeſus Chriſt was come in the Fleſh. Becauſe, this was a <hi>new Article</hi> of Faith neceſſary to be believed, and was in thoſe times a main <hi>point in queſtion,</hi> and by the Men of the times ſtrongly, (I mean violently) oppoſed. Thus it was a greater matter to believe, and confeſs Jeſus to be the Chriſt at that time, than for us to aſſent to this Truth, when it is generally owned, and profeſſed. As one well noteth: <q>We muſt <hi>diſtinguiſh times.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. Manton <hi>on</hi> Jam. 2.19. <hi>p.</hi> 305.</note> The Truths of God (then Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſo many prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Wind that bloweth on our Backs, blew in their Faces; and that which draweth on many to aſſent to the Goſpel, was their diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to prove, that a bare <hi>intellectual Aſſent</hi> is not true Saving-Faith, we need look no further than that Text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doſt well: the Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> The Apoſtle inſtanceth in this Article (as <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſays) becauſe in it eſpecially the <hi>Jews</hi> differed from <hi>Pagans,</hi> or becauſe it is the <hi>firſt Article</hi> of our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:92979:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>Faith. But he might queſtionleſs have added other Articles, which the Devils as well believe, and are convinced to be certain Truths. They believed <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 8.29. And that he was <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> Luk. 4.41. The Devil that puts others upon queſtioning, whether there be a God? Or, whether the Scriptures be the Word of God? hath no doubt of theſe things himſelf. He that would have Men <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi> is far from being either himſelf. Atheiſm, and Infidelity are Sins which the Devil cannot be guilty of. An Atheiſt, or an Infidel is in that reſpect, worſe than the Devil himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now certainly, <hi>that Faith</hi> which the Devils have, cannot be true <hi>Saving-Faith.</hi> But the Devils have ſuch a Faith as this, they are clearly convinced, that the Scriptures are the Word of God; and that what God's Word holds forth is certainly true. How abſurd, and irrational is it, to ſuppoſe that the Devils that are Damned, have that ſame Faith for the <hi>nature</hi> of it, which the Scripture calls <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith,</hi> and which it maketh the condition of Salvation?</p>
               <p>And yet miſtake me not.</p>
               <p>I grant, a <hi>Dogmatical Faith</hi> is included in <hi>Saving Faith.</hi> As the <hi>Vegetative</hi> Soul is included in the <hi>Senſitive;</hi> or as both theſe are included in the <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Soul: So a believing that there is a Chriſt, that he is <hi>come in the Fleſh,</hi> and a believing the Word of Chriſt is included in our <hi>believing in him.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they that believe not what is ſpoken of him in the Goſpel, that believe not the Son of God, his taking Mans Nature on him, uniting it to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that there was ſuch a one as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:92979:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>was born of a Virgin, that ſuffered, was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and roſe again from the dead, and aſcended up to Heaven, according to the Scriptures; they that <hi>allegorize</hi> the true Chriſt out of Doors, and only acknowledg a <hi>Chriſt within them,</hi> they do not believe in <hi>that Jeſus whom Paul preached,</hi> whom all the Apoſtles preached, <hi>whom the Father ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I further grant, that to believe with a <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Faith is part of <hi>Man's duty.</hi> It is a ſetting to our <hi>Seal, that God is true,</hi> Joh. 3.33. And <hi>he that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyer,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10. Think what an heinous Sin it is, to <hi>give God the Lye.</hi> If you deny his Truth, you deny him to be God. If he were not the God of Truth, he were not the true God.</p>
               <p>And further we muſt grant, that the Word is a great gift of God, that it is a wonderful favour that he is pleaſed thus to reveal his Mind and Will, and make himſelf known to the Sons of Men. And that it is a <hi>work of the Spirit</hi> (though but a <hi>common</hi> work, which ſuch may have as ſhall not be ſaved) to bring Men to <hi>aſſent</hi> to the Truth. All this is granted. But yet though we know the Truth, and cannot but aſſent to it in our <hi>Judgments;</hi> if we do not embrace it with ſuituble <hi>Affections,</hi> if we do not heartily cleave to it, and ſincerely ſubmit to it, our <hi>ſimple belief</hi> of the Truth, is ſo far from being a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work,</hi> that it will increaſe our Condemnation, as our guilt is increaſed by it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) True Saving-Faith is not a meer <hi>perſwaſion, that my Sins are pardoned,</hi> that I ſhall be Saved.</p>
               <p>Some have gone this way: <q>
                     <hi>Believe</hi> that your Sins are pardoned for Chriſt's ſake, and they are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:92979:24"/>pardoned, and you juſtifyed: <hi>Believe</hi> that you ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, and you ſhall be ſaved.</q> A <hi>ſhort cut</hi> to Heaven. But how little need is there to teach Men Preſumption, or to encourage it? But to ſhew you the Vanity of this conceit;</p>
               <p n="1">1. All that hear the Goſpel, are bound to <hi>believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But all ſuch are not bound to believe, that they are pardoned juſtifyed, and ſhall be ſaved. 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> And what Duty is more preſſed in the Goſpel? But where doth the Goſpel command all to believe, that they ſhall be ſaved? How many, (alas!) that are in their Sins, that are ſuch as the Word of God condemneth? <hi>Know ye not that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God?</hi> Such as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. believe contrary to the Goſpel, if (while ſuch) they believe, that they are pardoned, and ſhall be ſaved. The Goſpel calleth us to <hi>repent, that our Sins may be blotted out.</hi> And we have no ground to believe, or hope, that our Sins are pardoned, till we repent. When we find <hi>unbelief</hi> ſpoken of, as the great condemning Sin, we muſt not take it ſo, as if Sinners were condemned, becauſe they would not believe that their Sins were pardoned. Nor is it the ſenſe of <hi>that Article</hi> in our <hi>Creed [I believe the Remiſſion of Sins]</hi> that I believe my Sins are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Too many lay down this Concluſion, that yet ſtand condemned by the <hi>Sentence</hi> of God's Word. All impenitent Sinners are bound to believe, that at preſent they are in a ſtate of Wrath, Heirs appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Hell, that <hi>except they repent, they ſhall periſh,</hi> they cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:92979:24"/>
               <p n="2">2. Are we not <hi>juſtifyed by Faith?</hi> Deny that, and you deny plain Scripture. Now we cannot be <hi>juſtifyed by Faith,</hi> if we are firſt of all to believe that we are pardoned, and juſtified.
<note place="margin">Le Blanc. Theſ. Theol. <hi>p.</hi> 212. §. 103.</note> 
                  <hi>Quomodo enim poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus juſtificari per actum, qui juſtificationem jam factam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupponit?</hi> Muſt we believe, our Sins <hi>are</hi> pardoned, that they <hi>may be</hi> pardoned? Muſt we believe, we <hi>are</hi> Juſtifyed, that we <hi>may be</hi> Juſtifyed? What can be more abſurd? Then we muſt believe what is not, that it may be, as we believe. If the <hi>firſt Act</hi> of Faith be, to believe that I am pardoned and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed; then Remiſſion and Juſtification muſt needs go before Faith. (The <hi>Act</hi> ſuppoſeth the <hi>Object.</hi>) In <hi>order of Nature</hi> Faith is before Juſtification: (otherwiſe we are not <hi>juſtified by Faith</hi>) and <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature</hi> (at leaſt) we muſt be juſtified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can truly believe that we are juſtified. Therefore we cannot be juſtified, by believing we are ſo. It is a plain <hi>contradiction</hi> to ſay, that we believe before we are juſtified, and yet are juſtified before we believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cannot be the <hi>firſt Act</hi> of Faith, to believe I ſhall be ſaved, except inſtead of the Word, ſome <hi>ſpecial Revelation</hi> beſides the Word, be the Ground of my Faith. This is plain: becauſe it is not at all credible to me, according to the Word, that I ſhall be ſaved, till I know I have Faith, ſuch a Faith as hath Salvation annexed to it by promiſe, ſuch a Faith as <hi>purifieth the Heart, worketh by Love,</hi> &amp;c. According to the Word, only he that believeth with ſuch a Faith, ſhall be ſaved. That I cannot believe according to the Word, that I ſhall be ſaved, till I find ſuch a Faith
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:92979:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>wrought and working in me. Therefore this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that I ſhall be ſaved, cannot be the <hi>firſt Act</hi> of Faith. If it be a perſwaſion grounded on the Word, true Faith is preſuppoſed to go before. And the Apoſtle hath barred Mens expectation of ſpecial <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> here; Rom. 10.17. where he concludeth, that <hi>Faith cometh by hearing of the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Many have this <hi>confident perſwaſion,</hi> that their Sins are pardoned, that they ſhall be ſaved, who have not true juſtifying <hi>Saving-Faith:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely, this cannot be the proper <hi>formal Act</hi> of true juſtifying Saving-Faith. Many Hypocrites, and meer out-ſide Profeſſors, yea, many a wicked Man hath this perſwaſion. How hard a thing is it to take down Sinners confidence?
<note place="margin">Mr. Baxter.</note> 
                  <q>We have need (as one ſays) to lay all our <hi>Batteries</hi> againſt this <hi>Bulwark</hi> of Preſumption.</q> How many that will ſay, they hope to be ſaved by Chriſt; yea, they never doubted of their Salvation in all their Lives? They can argue, that Chriſt died to Save Sinners; and they are Sinners: therefore he died to Save them. If this be Faith, the caſe of many a <hi>Preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> is not ſo dangerous, but very happy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Many have <hi>true Faith,</hi> and are juſtified, and in a State of Salvation; yet have not this <hi>perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that their Sins are pardoned, dare not conclude, that they are in God's Favour, and ſuch as ſhall be ſaved. Therefore this cannot be the <hi>formal Act</hi> of Faith. Faith could not be without its formal Act. If you make this the <hi>formal Act</hi> of Faith, then you muſt ſay, there is no true Believer, but hath it. Then there is no true Believer, that <hi>walketh in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:92979:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>Darkneſs.</hi> But certainly a Soul may <hi>truſt in the name of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſtay upon his God,</hi> while yet he <hi>walketh in Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>can ſee no Light,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. Is it not the condition of many a dear Child of God, to be in great doubts, and full of fears about their Spiritual and Eternal Eſtate? Should we not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Generation of his Children,</hi> (many, yea the greateſt part of them) as <hi>Children that have no Faith;</hi> if we <hi>define</hi> Faith to be a believing that our Sins are pardoned, and that we ſhall be ſaved? Many a holy, humble Chriſtian goes on drooping even to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day; and it is well, if he come to this <hi>comfortable concluſion</hi> at laſt. As one giveth this as part of the <hi>Character</hi> of a Chriſtian;
<note place="margin">H. Palmer. <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes.</hi> p. 64. §. 73.</note> 
                  <q>He thinks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God hath no Mercy for him;</q> and yet reſolves to die in the purſuit of it. And to tell poor, troubled, afflicted Conſciences, that they cannot have <hi>Faith,</hi> who do not believe their Sins are pardoned, is not the way to comfort them; but to ſet them more on <hi>the Rack.</hi> This would make the Hearts of many ſad, even ſuch as God would not have <hi>made ſad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Such a particular perſwaſion that my Sins are pardoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be ſound, and well-grounded, is <hi>Knowledg,</hi> and not <hi>Faith.</hi> As the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> hath it (I think) ſome nine or ten times, <hi>[Hereby we know —]</hi> Obſerve well, 1 Joh. 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have Eternal Life, and that ye may believe on the Name of the Son of God.</hi> Where he clearly diſtinguiſheth <hi>believing</hi> on the Name of the Son of God, from their <hi>knowing</hi> that they had Eternal Life, or that they ſhould be ſaved.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:92979:26"/>What follows, <hi>[that ye might believe on the Name of the Son of God]</hi> is not ſpoken of the <hi>firſt Act,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Faith, but of continuance, and <hi>progreſs</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>And it is plain, that this <hi>particular perſwaſion</hi> (of which I am ſpeaking) if it be ſound, and have any good bottom, depends on two <hi>ſeveral Propoſitions,</hi> one of which is laid down in Scripture; as this Propoſition, <hi>[He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved.]</hi> The other is of a Man's own Conſcience, or from the knowledg a Man has of himſelf, <hi>[But I believe:]</hi> From whence this Concluſion follows, <hi>[therefore I ſhall be ſaved.]</hi> So that it is not an <hi>Act of Faith</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but a <hi>rational Concluſion,</hi> preſuppoſing theſe two things, 1. That all true Believers ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 2. That I know my ſelf to be a true Believer. Now can that be a right <hi>deſcription</hi> of Saving-Faith, which neceſſarily preſuppoſeth a Man to have Saving-Faith before, and to know that he hath it?</p>
               <p>Thus I have indeavoured to remove theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, and <hi>falſe Notions</hi> of Faith. Now I come to ſhew what it is.</p>
               <p>Indeed you may meet with diverſe <hi>ſound deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Faith, ſomething differing in <hi>words,</hi> that yet agree in the <hi>thing.</hi> I would not be one of thoſe, that make differences, where there are none; or make differences wider than they are.</p>

                  <q>By this Faith a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian believeth to be true, whatſoever is revealed in the Word, for the Authority of God himſelf ſpeaking therein; and acteth differently upon that which each particular paſſage thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, yeilding obedience to the Commands, trembling at the Threatnings, and embracing the Promiſes of God for this Life, and that which is to come. But the principal Acts of Saving-Faith, are accepting, receiving, and reſting upon Chriſt alone for Juſtification, Sanctification, and Eternal Life, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſhorter Catechiſm, <q>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is a Saving Grace, whereby we receive and reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him alone for Salvation, as he is offered to us in the Goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding a difference in Expreſſion, yet here is <hi>an agreement in ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I run not out too far, I ſhall only note ſomething of the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith and of the <hi>Acts</hi> of Faith.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:92979:27"/>
               <p>The <hi>Object</hi> of Faith is thus diſtinguiſhed; There is the <hi>general</hi> and common, or (according to others) the full and <hi>adaequate Object</hi> of Faith, and that is the whole Word of God, the Word of Truth, ſo Faith aſſenteth to the whole Word of God, as true. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, there is the <hi>ſpecial Object</hi> of Faith, and that is the Word of Promiſe; ſo Faith conſenteth to the terms, or condition of the Promiſe, and in this way relyeth on God, and Chriſt for performance. The Promiſe of Remiſſion and Salvation by Chriſt Faith takes ſpecial hold on, by <hi>conſent,</hi> and <hi>affiance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus, there is the <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Object of Faith: and the <hi>ſecondary,</hi> and <hi>leſs principal</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>The <hi>primary,</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Object of Faith are the <hi>fundamentals,</hi> eſſentials, and moſt neceſſary points of the Chriſtian Religion. Such Divine Doctrines, Promiſes, and Precepts, without <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> unto which, we cannot believe unto Salvation, or be ſound Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſhall not contend with thoſe that make <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>only Mediator</hi> and Saviour, the <hi>principal</hi> Object of Faith; foraſmuch as I doubt not, but we are agreed, that the <hi>belief of all that is neceſſary</hi> to be known and believed of Chriſt, doth ſuppoſe and include the belief of all other points, that are <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary</hi> to Salvation. And as he is the <hi>Chief</hi> and <hi>principal Means</hi> of bringing us to God, the Scriptures have a <hi>chief reference,</hi> and reſpect to Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecondary,</hi> and <hi>leſs principal</hi> Object of Faith takes in other things contained in the Word, that are of good uſe indeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. But though all Scripture be of uſe, and profitable,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:92979:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>yet all that is there written is not <hi>abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> to be diſtinctly known, and <hi>explicitely</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>And yet you may not hence infer, that if you know, and believe ſo much as is <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, there needeth no more. None are to ſtand at a ſtay in Religion. All that are in the <hi>School of Chriſt,</hi> muſt be making proficiency, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Faith and Knowledg. We ſhould diligently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the means, that the <hi>Word of Chriſt</hi> may dwell <hi>in us richly,</hi> that we may be filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Will.</p>
               <p>And further (as a late Writer noteth) there are <q>points of Faith <hi>ſecondarily fundamental,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fowler. <hi>Deſign of Chriſtianity.</hi> p. 235.</note> the disbelief of which cannot conſiſt with true Holineſs, in thoſe to whom the Goſpel is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently made known. And — all ſuch Doctrines as are with <hi>indiſputable clearneſs</hi> revealed to us, the belief of theſe is <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> from an <hi>external cauſe,</hi> though not from the <hi>nature</hi> of the points themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of their <hi>perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,</hi> that nothing can cauſe Men to refuſe to admit them, but that which argueth them to be ſtark naught, and to have ſome unworthy and baſe end in ſo doing</q> (or in the phraſe of Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Note one thing more touching the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That more is taken into the <hi>neceſſary Object</hi> of Faith now under the Goſpel than was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary before. The Myſtery of our Redemption by Chriſt, being more fully unfolded in the Goſpel, a more diſtinct, explicite Faith in Chriſt is required
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:92979:28"/>of us, than was required of thoſe to whom leſs was revealed. <hi>Revelatio eſt menſura Fidei.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Le Blanc.</note> Though <hi>Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and all the faithful before Chriſt, were juſtified and ſaved by Faith; yet not by that ſpecial kind of Faith, that ſuch as live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel are ſaved by. I mean, there are <hi>new Articles</hi> of Faith, relating to Chriſt, his Office, and Undertaking, as Mediator, <hi>eſſential</hi> to a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Faith,</hi> that were not eſſential to Faith before the promulgation of the Goſpel. Nor did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves believe ſome of them, till after Chriſt's Reſurrection, concerning whom (excepting <hi>Judas</hi>) we have no doubt, but they were true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>Next, to ſhew you the ſpecial and <hi>proper Acts</hi> of Faith. They ſpeak much in a little, that call Faith a <hi>practical Aſſent,</hi> and a <hi>fiducial Conſent.</hi> I cannot exclude any of theſe three Acts, <hi>Aſſent, Conſent,</hi> and <hi>Affiance.</hi> The two laſt are plainly expreſſed in the <hi>ſhorter Catechiſm:</hi> and all three fully in the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of Faith forecited.

               </p>
               <p>And it ſhould not ſeem ſtrange, that ſo much is taken into the nature of true Faith. As Divines now generally place it, not in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in the <hi>Will</hi> only; but in both <hi>faculties conjunct,</hi> (if they be diſtinct faculties, and not the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:92979:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Soul diſpoſed, and acting differently towards the Object, conſidered in a different no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſpect.) And methinks it is plain in Scripture, that the Faith to which Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, doth not conſiſt in one <hi>ſingle Act;</hi> for there are theſe diverſe Acts even now mentioned, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>Aſsent.</hi> An Aſſent to the Truth of the Word in general, and <hi>particularly</hi> to the Promiſe of Salvation by Chriſt. Though I ſhewed before, that Faith conſiſts not barely in Aſſent, that this is not the <hi>whole of Faith;</hi> yet we cannot deny, but this is part of it. We find Faith thus deſcribed again and again: that we muſt acknowledg it <hi>one Act</hi> of Faith. It would be ſtrange indeed, if a <hi>belief of the Truth</hi> be no part of Faith. Then <hi>Martha</hi> anſwered nothing to the Queſtion, Joh. 11.26, 27. when ſhe ſaid, yea, <hi>Lord I believe that thou art the Chriſt.</hi> So ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9.</p>
               <p>But how does Faith aſſent to Divine Truth?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith aſſenteth <hi>really</hi> not feignedly. A true Believer doth not only profeſs, or confeſs with his Mouth, but <hi>believes in his Heart,</hi> as he profeſſeth to believe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith aſſents <hi>firmly,</hi> not waveringly. It riſeth higher than <hi>opinion.</hi> It is more than a <hi>Semi-perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the Truth. As they ſaid, <hi>[We believe, and are ſure.]</hi> Not as <hi>Agrippa, almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant, that as all Chriſtians have not the ſame meaſure of Spiritual-Knowledg, and as there are <hi>different degrees</hi> of Faith; ſo all Believers have not the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>firmneſs</hi> of Aſſent. And Faith does
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:92979:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>not wholly <hi>exclude</hi> all doubtings, but <hi>overcometh</hi> them. Indeed ſometimes very horrid thoughts ariſe, or are injected, that would put the Soul upon que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning all: but they are not entertained but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily abhorred, and rejected, as they come. As one ſays,
<note place="margin">Herb. Palmer. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes,</hi> p. 64. §. 72.</note> 
                  <q>He is ſometimes ſo troubled, that he thinks nothing is true in Religion; and yet if he did think ſo, he could not be at all troubled.</q> It is true, thus a Believer ſometimes is ſore ſhaken, yet not quite taken off from all: but rather put upon earneſt Prayer, and indeavours to be more rooted, and grounded in Faith. So theſe <hi>ſhakings</hi> are wont to end in his more <hi>firm eſtabliſhment.</hi> And take the weakeſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever out of ſuch a ſwounding-fit, and he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily a deeper ſenſe of Divine Truths, and a <hi>ſtronger aſſent</hi> to them, than others whoſe Faith is unſound; (though theſe may have a far greater meaſure of <hi>Notional</hi> Knowledg) even ſuch an Aſſent, that he dare venture his Soul, and all his hopes and concerns <hi>deliberately</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith aſſents <hi>freely.</hi> In this ſenſe it is true, that <hi>with the Heart Man believeth.</hi> Some are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth, but ſore againſt their Wills. There Aſſent is a <hi>forced,</hi> not a free Aſſent. As ſome are <hi>willingly Ignorant;</hi> ſo ſome again are <hi>knowing unwillingly.</hi> As <hi>Light</hi> is troubleſome to <hi>ſore Eyes;</hi> ſo Knowledg and Convictions to unſound Minds. And they put off convictions as long as they can. Though they may take ſome delight in <hi>ſpeculative Truths,</hi> though they may not be offended at ſome <hi>practical</hi> Truths; yet thoſe Soul-ſearching, and practical Truths, that would come neareſt, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:92979:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>that moſt concern them, they are ſtrongly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt. A true Believer would not reſiſt the Truth, would not ſhut it out. He willingly yields to, and takes part with God's Truth, when he knows it, even againſt any <hi>Errour,</hi> or <hi>ſinful practice,</hi> he had been for before. And ſo,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith aſſents <hi>impartially.</hi> A Believer aſſents to the whole Word of God in general, and to every thing which he ſees held forth in God's Word as true. And we receive no Truth upon the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Authority of God in his Word, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not every thing for Truth, which we ſee his Word for. <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia.</hi> A partial Aſſent, or yielding to ſome Truths, with a rejection of others, which we ſee as clearly laid down in the Word, will not ſtand with true Faith.</p>
               <p>Certainly, I cannot have the Faith of a Chriſtian without believing the <hi>Trinity</hi> in Unity, the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> Death, and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of Mans Redemption, and Salvation by him. But now when <hi>carnal reaſonings</hi> are ſubdued, and a Man is come to aſſent to thoſe great <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and <hi>chief Articles</hi> of Faith (where the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty lay) he will more eaſily aſſent to other points of leſs difficulty, ſeeing them confirmed by the ſame <hi>Divine Teſtimony,</hi> upon which he reſts aſſured of the Truth of thoſe <hi>higher Myſteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus though <hi>good Men and true Believers</hi> may err, and differ in <hi>controvertible</hi> points, in points <hi>not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi> or eſſential to true Chriſtianity; yet they are agreed in this <hi>common Principle,</hi> That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord ſaith in his Word, is true. And therefore when they ſee the Scripture againſt any
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:92979:30"/>
                  <hi>opinion</hi> they have held, it immediately puts an end to the <hi>Controverſy.</hi> They dare not hold any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contrary to known Scripture. As for thoſe that are for bringing <hi>Scripture</hi> to their <hi>opinions,</hi> and not for bringing their opinions to Scripture, and ſuch as obſtinately maintain their errours againſt clear evidence of God's Word, which they ſee, and will not ſee; they muſt needs be of <hi>corrupt Minds,</hi> and <hi>reprobate concerning the Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet further, to ſhew the <hi>impartiality</hi> of Faith's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Divine Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby a Believer aſſents to the Truth of any thing he ſees God's Word for, without any other reaſon. As indeed it is moſt unreaſonable not to believe that God, who cannot Lye, who cannot be deceived, or deceive, Heb. 11.1.

                  <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Faith takes it for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof, and good <hi>demonſtration,</hi> that a thing is ſo; becauſe God ſaith it, when it doth not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at all appear to a Man's Sence or Reaſon.</p>

Where the ſame thing may be proved both by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and by <hi>humane Reaſon (e.g.</hi> that the World was created, and had a beginning, as we are taught in the Scripture, we may alſo prove it by Reaſon;) yet a Believer more chearfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſceth in the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of God in his Word, is better ſatisfied with that, than with any <hi>Arguments</hi> a Philoſopher could bring for it.

               <p n="3">3. A Believer aſſents to the Truth of the Word, in things that are quite <hi>above Mans Reaſon.</hi>

                  </note> As that there are three Perſons, yet but one God: that the Son of God took Mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that there are two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt, yet but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that there ſhall be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body, the ſame <hi>numerical</hi> Body, though reſolved into Duſt, ſhall be raiſed again, and re-united to the Soul: Such points as quite <hi>non-plus</hi> humane reaſon, Faith takes for great, and certain <hi>Verities.</hi> Where natural Reaſon would ſay, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> Faith will readily conclude, they muſt certainly be true, being atteſted by the God of Truth.</p>
               <p>And yet (by the way) here is nothing for the <hi>Popiſh Monſter</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> for where hath God ſaid, that upon the words of Conſecration, the <hi>Bread</hi> is turned into <hi>Chriſts Body?</hi> Or from what Word of God is ſo much neceſſarily inferred?</p>
               <p n="4">4.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:92979:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>danger. Faith will give us to ſee, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is more excellent than his neighbour, even when ſuch are commonly eſteemed, as the filth of the World, and off-ſcouring of all things. Thus Faith aſſents to divine Truth <hi>impartially.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Aſſent of true Faith is an <hi>holding Aſſent.</hi> Men have not <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>And though doubtings even of the Truth of the Word, and Goſpel, may ſometimes ariſe; yet the Souls <hi>Aſſent</hi> to the Truth is certainly <hi>predominant,</hi> when thus it <hi>caſts the Seale.</hi> Such doubtings are not predominant, and therefore not inconſiſtent with Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus I am led to the ſecond <hi>Act</hi> of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Faith doth not barely Aſſent, but <hi>Conſent.</hi> Thus <hi>with the Heart Man believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.10. And they that ſuppoſe Faith to be ſeated both in the <hi>

               <p>If I truly believe the Promiſe, then <hi>I no otherwiſe</hi> expect, or hope that it ſhould be made good, and performed to me, then upon my conſenting to, and performing the condition. And the ſoundneſs and

                  <hi>firmneſs</hi> of ones <hi>Aſſent</hi> may well be queſtioned here, when this conſent does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

                  <q>As all Men would take another courſe (ſays an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Writer) if they did but <hi>ſee Heaven and Hell with their Eyes;</hi> ſo all Men would preſently throw away their worldly, fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, and turn to God, and an holy Life, if they did but as <hi>throughly believe</hi> the Joys and Torments to come, <hi>as if they ſaw them.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And that <hi>Saving-Faith</hi> does always include in it a <hi>conſent to the condition,</hi> on which Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is plain and evident: becauſe no other Faith is <hi>Saving,</hi> but that which does thus conſent. The <hi>ſtrongeſt aſſent</hi> to the Truth, without this, is but the <hi>Faith of Devils:</hi> ſo likewiſe the moſt <hi>confident reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> on God, and Chriſt, and the Promiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, is meer and groſs <hi>Preſumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after what manner does a true Believer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and accept of Gods terms?</p>
               <p n="1">1. He conſents fully, <hi>not partially.</hi> He conſents to the whole New-Covenant, not to a part only. That cannot be Saving-Faith, which conſents not to all, that God hath made of <hi>indiſpenſible neceſſity</hi> to Salvation, <hi>without which</hi> God hath declared, that we cannot be ſaved. Therefore the fore-cited Author (as I remember) ſomewhere calleth Faith, <q>The <hi>great ſummary Duty</hi> of the Goſpel, and the <hi>ſummary Condition</hi> of the Covenant, implying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, or inferring all the reſt, and to which they are reducible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, If the Goſpel require, as neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that we take God for our <hi>chief ultimate End</hi> and Happineſs; and take Chriſt for our <hi>only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:92979:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>as <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King;</hi> and take the Holy Spirit for our <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> (as certainly it doth, and our Covenant with God in Baptiſm obligeth to all this:) to all this Faith <hi>conſents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we take that <hi>deſcription</hi> of Faith in the <hi>ſhorter Catechiſm. ſcil.</hi> That it is <hi>A receiving Jeſus Chriſt, as he is offered</hi> to us in the Goſpel: it implieth as much. He is offered, not only as a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> but as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> to teach us the Will of God; and as a <hi>King,</hi> to rule us by his Laws, and by his Grace and Spirit.</p>
               <p>This is certain, there can be no <hi>receiving</hi> of Chriſt but as he is <hi>offered.</hi> No thinking to have Chriſt, whether he will, or no: whether God will, or no. He that is called, <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> muſt be received, as God offers him, or we have nothing to do with him, we have no <hi>Title</hi> to him. And Chriſt was never offered to any, as a <hi>Saviour only.</hi> Indeed he is held forth in the Word as the <hi>only Saviour (there is Salvation in no other)</hi> but not as a <hi>Saviour only. Him hath God exalted to be a Prince, as well as a Saviour,</hi> Act. 5.31. and Chap. 2.36. And <hi>to this end</hi> Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, <hi>that he might be Lord,</hi> Rom. 14.9. And he is the <hi>Author of Salvation</hi> only <hi>to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. So we read of <hi>Faith in our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, Act. 16.31. and 20.21. So true Faith does not only eye his <hi>Croſs;</hi> but alſo boweth to his <hi>Scepter;</hi> acknowledgeth his <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> as well as his <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> well, <q>We muſt take heed of disjoyning thoſe things,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of Faith.</hi> p. 42.</note> that God hath joyned together. We muſt take Chriſt as well for a <hi>Lord,</hi> as a <hi>Saviour. — Mark it diligently,</hi> If thou wilt take Chriſt as a Saviour only, that will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:92979:33"/>not ſerve the turn; Chriſt giveth not himſelf to any <hi>upon that condition,</hi> only to ſave him: but we muſt take him as a Lord too, to be ſubject to him, to obey him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And as another, (that I have ſomewhere met with) To receive Chriſt <hi>only as a Prophet</hi> is but a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Faith; to receive him <hi>only as a King,</hi> is but a <hi>legal kind</hi> of Faith; to receive him <hi>only as a Prieſt,</hi> is but a <hi>carnal</hi> Faith: but to receive him in <hi>all his Offices</hi> together, this is a true <hi>Evangelical</hi> and Saving-Faith.</p>
               <p>Here I am upon a point of <hi>grand concern</hi> indeed, not to be haſtily paſſed over. As a partial Aſſent, ſo a <hi>partial Conſent</hi> will prove ones Faith not to be ſound. Saving-Faith willingly accepts of whole Chriſt, accepts of Chriſt in <hi>all his Offices,</hi> and not only of ſome particular benefit by him. Chriſt will not be <hi>divided.</hi> We muſt have <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>none.</hi> Who would not but be pardoned and ſaved? But we cannot have Remiſſion, and Salvation alone. Chriſt will not be their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> who will not accept of him for their <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> their Teacher and Ruler. Indeed we cannot receive Chriſt, as a <hi>perfect Saviour,</hi> if we receive him not in all his Offices. He is <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> that ſo he may be a <hi>compleat Redeemer,</hi> that he may ſave his People <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to the uttermoſt.</hi> Heb. 7.25. So he hath his name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he <hi>ſaves his People from their Sins</hi> (Mar. 1.21.) and not only from miſery, and <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10.</p>
               <p>Therefore if you are not for <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> but only for ſome of his Benefits: if you are for ſome of his benefits, but not for others: for Remiſſion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:92979:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>Juſtification, but not for Sanctification: for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <hi>in the end,</hi> but not for the <hi>way</hi> leading to it: if you would be ſaved <hi>in</hi> your Sins, not <hi>from</hi> your Sins: if you are willing to hear of a Chriſtians <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> by Chriſt, but have no ſuch mind to hear of Chriſtian <hi>Duties:</hi> if you had rather be from under <hi>Chriſts Yoak,</hi> ſet free from his Laws (might it be at your choice, and after your minds) than live in Obedience and Subjection to him: if it be thus, it is <hi>a clear caſe</hi> your Faith is unſound, you do not yet <hi>conſent</hi> to the terms of the Goſpel, or conſent but <hi>partially.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have often heard what a <hi>rich</hi> and great <hi>Match</hi> Chriſt is, and how willing he is to beſtow Himſelf, with all his Riches <hi>(unſearchable Riches)</hi> upon the Children of Men, and hereupon ('tis likely) you wiſh to have the <hi>Eſtate.</hi> An <hi>Eſtate of Happineſs,</hi> to be freed from all Miſery, and a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory,</hi> to <hi>have and to hold for ever,</hi> who would not but be glad of ſuch an <hi>Eſtate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſo much <hi>Self-Love</hi> in the moſt wicked Man on Earth, (no doubt) that he would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, when he dies: he would not be damned; but would chuſe Heaven, before Hell, if he might have Heaven in his <hi>own way,</hi> and time. But hold! you cannot have the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> without marrying the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> If you like well of Chriſt, to take him for your <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> and are willing to give up your ſelves to him, to be guided, and governed by him; then you ſhall be for ever enriched by him, and <hi>glorified together</hi> with him: otherwiſe not.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, We would have Chriſt, we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take him for our <hi>Saviour:</hi> if that be all, you cannot have him on any ſuch terms. Here is an

                  <hi>Errour of the Perſon.</hi> And though it be diſputable in other Marriages, what <hi>Errour of the Perſon</hi> is nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; yet there is no queſtion in the caſe before us, but this <hi>Errour of the Perſon</hi> will make it no Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. It is another <hi>kind of Perſon,</hi> who is offered to you in the Goſpel. The Goſpel knoweth <hi>no ſuch Chriſt,</hi> as is a <hi>Saviour</hi> only, and not a <hi>Lord</hi> as well. What! would you have Chriſt to <hi>Crucify</hi> him? would you have him to dethrone him? So you do (what in you lyeth) if you are not willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as <hi>Lord,</hi> as well as Saviour. Now how can you think, that Chriſt ſhould <hi>conſent</hi> to be <hi>yours</hi> on ſuch terms?</p>
               <p>But on the other hand: if thou canſt ſay, Lord, I aſſent to the Promiſes of the Goſpel <hi>as true,</hi> and embrace them as <hi>good</hi> indeed, and <hi>worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation:</hi> Lord, I accept of thy terms, I conſent to take thee for <hi>my God,</hi> to be ruled by thy Laws, and led by thy Spirit; and to take up with Thee for <hi>my Portion:</hi> I conſent that Chriſt be my <hi>Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>Saviour;</hi> I am willing to come under his <hi>Yoak,</hi> yea, to take up his <hi>Croſs</hi> too, when called to it: I am ſatisfied, that I cannot have him on too hard terms, nor be a loſer by him. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſaved by him in his <hi>own way,</hi> willing to be at his <hi>Command,</hi> and at his <hi>diſpoſe:</hi> ſurely, this is a <hi>Practical</hi> Faith, a ſound, and Saving-Faith.</p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou know, whether thou haſt true Faith, ſuch as uniteth to Chriſt, and may prove ones <hi>Intereſt</hi> in him? Then ask thy Soul this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Am I willing to have <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> willing to receive him as he is offered? Do I accept of him on his own terms? If ſo, then know thy <hi>Faith</hi> is Sound, and Chriſt <hi>is thine.</hi> Then indeed the <hi>Match</hi>

Though that which firſt moves a poor Sinner to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt for his <hi>Lord,</hi> and to forſake his <hi>old Maſters,</hi> Sin, and the World, be this, that Chriſt is a <hi>Saviour</hi> to thoſe who take him for their <hi>Lord</hi> too;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:92979:35"/>yet not till the Soul is made willing thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, that it can be ſaid to have a Goſpel-Faith, <hi>Saving</hi> Faith. A <hi>partial</hi> conſent in a <hi>Moral,</hi> and <hi>Law-ſenſe,</hi> is no conſent. And God and Souls are not agreed, while they only conſent to one part of the Covenant, refuſing other terms he hath made <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the Agreement. Such a <hi>lame</hi> conſent will never bring a Soul to Chriſt or Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A true Believer conſents <hi>deliberately.</hi> He can give a good account why he thus cloſeth with Chriſt. He ſees himſelf loſt, periſhing, <hi>undone for ever</hi> without Chriſt: but that he is <hi>made for ever,</hi> and hath all he can deſire in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and therefore ſhall have it in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> too, having Chriſt.

               <p>Here we may take notice, that as the <hi>Law of works,</hi> given to Man at firſt, was very ſuitable to Man's <hi>innocent eſtate;</hi> So is the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> (the <hi>remedying</hi> Law) ſuited to Man's <hi>lapſed nature.</hi> And God, in bringing Men to Grace, to Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, worketh upon Men, <hi>as Men,</hi> as reaſonable Creatures, who have <hi>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:92979:35"/>that the very <hi>natural Man</hi> deſires, and ſome that <hi>corrupted</hi> nature is againſt. Now it is therefore the <hi>eſtabliſhed way</hi> of Chriſt, to <hi>promiſe</hi> us thoſe which we can deſire, <hi>on condition</hi> that we will alſo accept of, and ſubmit to thoſe that we are <hi>againſt.</hi> Not but that his Grace doth <hi>diſpoſe</hi> Men to the performance of ſuch conditions: but his Grace worketh by <hi>means:</hi> and a <hi>conditional</hi> Promiſe is his <hi>ſtabliſhed means</hi> to draw Mans Heart to the performance of the Condition (which well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is a ſufficient <hi>anſwer</hi> to the Arguments that are commonly urged againſt the <hi>conditionality</hi> of the Promiſes.) As the Spirit worketh <hi>powerfully</hi> within, ſo he uſeth that word from without,
<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And the like obſervation we may take concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the Word. Therein ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſome ſuch <hi>evil,</hi> as we naturally <hi>abhor</hi> and dread, is threatned, either to excite us to our duty, which our corrupt hearts and natures are exceeding back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to; or to deter us from Sin, to which we are naturally prone, and ſtrongly inclined.</p>
               <p>Now to apply theſe things to the point in hand. The Believer is made ſenſible what a Sinner he has been, and what woe and wrath is due to Sin and Sinners, that indeed he has deſerved Hell for his Portion; yet withal he believes, according to the Word, that <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling Sinners unto himſelf: that he ſo loved the World, as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life:</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt is the only, and an all-ſufficient Saviour: that he is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:92979:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>willing,</hi> as well as <hi>able</hi> to ſave thoſe that come to God by him: But withal that there is no coming to him only as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo as to find welcome; but he muſt come to him alſo, as a <hi>Leader</hi> and <hi>Commander,</hi> reſolving ſincerely to obey and follow him: that without <hi>taking his Yoak</hi> upon us, we cannot <hi>find reſt for our Souls.</hi> To theſe things a Believer cannot but ſubſcribe. Theſe things are ſet home, and kept cloſe to his Heart: and ſuch Truths as theſe, being <hi>mixed with Faith,</hi> firmly aſſented to, they <hi>work effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.</hi> Thus he deliberately makes choice of Chriſt, as the only <hi>meet help</hi> for his Soul in all the World.</p>
               <p>Now go to Hypocrites, and Unbelievers, and it appears, they have but ſome faint, and <hi>weak Aſſent</hi> to the foreſaid Truths. Did they really believe Heaven, and Hell; and that without an intereſt in Chriſt there is no hope of Heaven, but to Hell they muſt go, all the World cannot ſave them; how is it poſſible they ſhould make ſo light of Chriſt as they do, preferring a momentary pleaſure, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worldly pelf before him, which a true Believer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts but dung, and traſh? If you tell a Man, there is a Lyon in the way behind him, with open mouth ready to devour him, and he flees not as for his Life; does it not plainly ſhew, that he believes not what you ſay? So, that Sinners do not flee to Chriſt, it ſhews they do not believe their miſery, and danger out of Chriſt. Or, if ſometimes they have ſtrong <hi>Convictions,</hi> that ſtartle and terrify them, they have <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Devices,</hi> to put them off. They will not ſuffer them to ſtay. Their corrupt Wills and Affections call off their thoughts from ſuch things, as moſt nearly concern them. As we read,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:92979:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>Mat. 13.15. <hi>Their Eyes they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and ſhould underſtand with their Heart, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them. Their Eyes they have cloſed.</hi> Thus poor Sinners <hi>wink hard,</hi> ſhut the Windows, to keep out the Light, that they may ſtill ſleep on in Sin. Or when they can be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger quiet, as they are, then they <hi>bribe</hi> their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and deceive themſelves with a ſeeming Faith, a ſeeming Converſion, a ſeeming Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they take up with as ſufficient: as poor <hi>Laodicea</hi> thought her ſelf rich. Thus by one means or other they are kept off from a ſerious, and deliberate cloſing with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But then come to a ſound Believer, and he is as ſure, that the Word of God will prove true, as that <hi>there is a God</hi> (which is as ſure as that there are any Creatures in the World:) and ſo that Heaven, and Hell are not <hi>Fancies,</hi> which have a being only in Mens imaginations; but unqueſtionable <hi>realities:</hi> that all Miſeries, and Sufferings in this life are caſe and pleaſure, compared with the Torments of Hell, and Miſeries of the Damned: and all the Pleaſures and enjoyments of this Life, but pain and loſs, compared with the Joys of Heaven: that if ever he be ſaved, he muſt be ſaved <hi>by Chriſt:</hi> and that he cannot hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, but in <hi>his own way.</hi> Thus he ſees it unqueſtionably his grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to accept of Chriſt as he is offered. And ſuch Truths being <hi>ſet home</hi> by the Spirit, with Power and Evidence, they have a mighty force to <hi>pull down ſtrong-holds,</hi> and <hi>carnal reaſonings</hi> in the Heart againſt them, to bring into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt. And thus the Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:92979:37"/>are wrought upon. And what <hi>ſorrow</hi> then,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Dr.</hi> Preſton <hi>of Effectual Faith.</hi> p. 204.</note> to think of ones former natural and ſinful State? and what <hi>Fear?</hi> O what will become of me, if I get not a Part, and Intereſt in Chriſt! If I fall ſhort of Heaven at laſt, then where am I? how miſerable ſhall I be to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? And what <hi>vehement deſire</hi> after Chriſt? Give me Chriſt, or I die. And what <hi>reſolution</hi> in the Will? I will go to Chriſt, and give up my ſelf to him, and caſt my ſelf upon him: <hi>If I periſh, I periſh.</hi> Lord, whither ſhould I go? Thou haſt the words of Eternal Life. Thus a Believer conſents, and cloſeth with Chriſt <hi>deliberately,</hi> upon clear convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he has no other way to take.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A true Believer conſents <hi>unfeignedly,</hi> and heartily. True Faith is <hi>Faith unfeigned.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. A Sound Believer does not take up with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith in Chriſt, and of ſubjection to him, does not think it enough to ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> to ſpeak honourably of him: but hath his <hi>heart opened</hi> to receive the <hi>King of Glory.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is his deſire, and choice indeed. And as he had rather have Chriſt alone for his <hi>Portion,</hi> than the whole World without him; ſo he had rather be <hi>ſubject</hi> to the Laws of Chriſt, than <hi>freed</hi> from them. Though the <hi>Fleſh</hi> is ſtill <hi>luſting</hi> in him <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Law in his Members rebelling againſt the Law of his Mind;</hi> yet he can truly ſay, his Will is more to Chriſt, and to his Service; than to pleaſe and gratify the Fleſh, and to ſerve Sin. And he repents not of any thing he does for Chriſt, but is grieved and aſhamed that he does no more, and that what he hath done, has been done in no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:92979:37"/>better manner: but he heartily repents of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sin heretofore, and of what he hath done diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto Chriſt. And in the ordinary, <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> and <hi>prevailing bent</hi> of his will, he is for taking part with Chriſt, and his Laws againſt the luſtings of the Fleſh, againſt the motions and workings of remaining corruption in him. He is ſo willing and deſirous of Chriſt and his Grace, that he would have them above all things, that may <hi>ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition;</hi> above all the pleaſures, or advantages of Sin, and the World. Yea, he would have Chriſt, though he was to beg with him, to ſuffer with him. He is willing to deny himſelf for Chriſt. And ſo,</p>
               <p n="4">4. He conſents <hi>reſolvedly,</hi> and firmly. Before Faith, a Man is at <hi>[ſhall I, ſhall I?]</hi> He may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have a ſudden motion towards Chriſt: but the Fleſh and the World ſoon draw him quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. But Faith quite turns the Scale. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> Believers have ſome mind towards Jeſus Chriſt, they are a little <hi>in love</hi> with him <hi>by fits:</hi> but their Minds ſoon change; eſpecially when they are threatned with perſecution, they are wont to take offence at the <hi>Croſs</hi> and draw back, they go not thorow with him. But the true Believer is <hi>married</hi> unto Chriſt, hath <hi>taken him for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, to Love, Honour, and Obey him even until Death.</hi> As the Apoſtle, Phil. 3.8. — <hi>For whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things. Have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:</hi> — but did he not hereupon repent his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? O no! he had as high an eſteem of Chriſt, as much affection for Chriſt, as ever. After all his Loſſes, after his Sufferings for Chriſt, he was ſtill of the ſame Mind. <hi>I have ſuffered the loſs of all things
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:92979:38"/>for him,</hi> (ſays he) and (as it follows) <hi>I do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you may ask here, Who can tell, whether he ſhall hold out, or no? Have not ſome gone a great way, and yet fallen off again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. However <hi>this note</hi> is of uſe ſo far, as to diſcover the unſoundneſs of their Faith, who <hi>fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> As <hi>they that draw back,</hi> are oppoſed to <hi>them that believe.</hi> Such did never truly believe, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly reſolved for Chriſt. Had they taken Chriſt without any ſinful reſerve, they would have ſtuck to him. A Believer <hi>falleth</hi> ſometimes; yet does not <hi>fall away.</hi> He <hi>falleth forward,</hi> not <hi>backward.</hi> Still his Heart is towards Chriſt, and his ſettled, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual,</hi> prevailing reſolution for Chriſt; and ſo he <hi>riſeth from his falls.</hi> And therefore, 2. If indeed we <hi>cleave</hi> to Chriſt with full <hi>purpoſe of Heart,</hi> we may thence conclude, that we ſhall keep to him. Then we ſhall be <hi>kept by the Power of God through Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. And <hi>ſhall not be tempted above that we are able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. Having God's <hi>Promiſe</hi> here, we ſhould reſt upon, and not diſtruſt his <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> Indeed to run ordinarily, and wilfully upon Temptations, is a thing contrary to Grace, contrary to ſuch an <hi>habitual</hi> reſolution for Chriſt. A Sound and Holy reſolution to ſtick to Chriſt <hi>armeth</hi> the Soul, and ſets it on its <hi>watch</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Temptations, that would draw it from Chriſt, (and which is more) ſets the Soul under a Promiſe of a gracious Divine Protection.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee whether we thus conſent unto Chriſt, and to the terms on which Salvation is offered in and with him. Do we conſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, not partially ſeriouſly and deliberately,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:92979:38"/>heartily and willingly, firmly and reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>So I come to a third <hi>Act</hi> of Faith, which is</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Affiance.</hi> Faith is a <hi>firm Aſſent,</hi> it is a <hi>practical Aſſent</hi> (ſuch as draws the will to conſent) and it is a <hi>fiducial Aſſent.</hi> Of this I am next to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Fiducia,</hi> or <hi>Truſt,</hi> is oft uſed by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> for confidence, and <hi>full perſwaſion,</hi> which is ſeparable from true Faith. But it may alſo be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>reſting,</hi> or <hi>relying</hi> on God, and Jeſus Chriſt; and being ſo taken it is an <hi>Act</hi> of Faith ordinarily put forth, and however always <hi>included</hi> in Faith, as to the <hi>habit</hi> of it. A Believer reſolves to venture, and caſt himſelf upon Chriſt, how much ſoever he be in doubt of the event and iſſue. As it was with <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> This <hi>Affiance,</hi> relyance, and recumbency upon Chriſt ſeemeth to be pointed at in the phraſes of <hi>believing in,</hi> and <hi>believing on</hi> him. Which ſome would have tranſlated, <hi>truſt in,</hi> or <hi>truſt on him.</hi> As <hi>(v. g.)</hi> Joh. 14.1. <hi>Ye do truſt,</hi> or, <hi>Do ye truſt in God,</hi> or on God? <hi>truſt alſo in me,</hi> or on me. As the word <hi>truſt,</hi> or <hi>hope</hi> is uſed, Mat. 12.21. <hi>In his Name ſhall the Gentiles</hi>

A <hi>depoſiting</hi> our greateſt Concerns with him. The believing Soul caſts it ſelf upon Chriſt, ventures its All with him.</p>
               <p>And no doubt but they that give us this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or they that put this into the definition of Faith, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that it is <hi>A reſting upon Chriſt alone for Salvation:</hi> no doubt I ſay, but they were aware of that <hi>great errour,</hi> and miſtake formerly ſo common, making Faith <hi>a full perſwaſion</hi> of the Heart, &amp;c.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:92979:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>Faith. And ſo was that <hi>French Divine</hi> (before cited) that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it,
<note place="margin">Jo.

Which is a quite different thing from Faith, as I have before ſhewed.</p>
               <p>And yet Alas! how many poor Souls that are ſtill under the ſame miſtake! Many that complain, they cannot <hi>believe;</hi> when their meaning is, they cannot but fear, that they are not ſuch, unto whom God hath promiſed the benefits of Remiſſion, and Salvation. And yet if they be asked, <q>Do you not <hi>believe the truth</hi> of whatſoever God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or promiſed? And are you not <hi>willing to have Chriſt, as he is offered,</hi> to ſanctify, as well as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you, to rule, as well as redeem and ſave you? And do you not <hi>believe</hi> both his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs</hi> to ſave all that heartily accept of him on his own terms: and that Salvation can be no other way obtained? And therefore (notwithſtanding all your doubts and fears about the ſincerity of your acceptance of him, yet) do you not reſolve to <hi>caſt your ſelves on him?</hi> and do you not look to him alone for Salvation?</q> This they could not deny, without <hi>bearing falſe Witneſs</hi> againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now this is <hi>Faith;</hi> though all that have it cannot ſee it in themſelves: and therefore many true Believers doubt, whether they are pardoned, and ſhall be ſaved.</p>

               <p>In Faith there is a <hi>believing application</hi> of Chriſt and the Promiſes.

Indeed the holy <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſſent</hi> to the truth of the Goſpel fully, and are marvellouſly taken with, admire and delight in the glorious <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Divine Grace, therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: but it is not their duty, and concern, <hi>to apply</hi> theſe things to themſelves. But Believers <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> theſe things, as moſt <hi>nearly concerning</hi> them. Though there be not always a <hi>ſenſible application</hi> of Chriſt and the Promiſe with Faith, (which one calleth an <hi>Axiomatical Application;</hi>) ſo as to ſay, and conclude, that Chriſt is mine, and the Promiſe, or promiſed benefits are mine; yet there is a <hi>real ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> a willing acceptance of Chriſt, and reſolved adherence, recumbency, and dependance on him.</p>
               <p>And yet I grant, that this <hi>Affiance,</hi> and Recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency on Chriſt, (though it is certainly in the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> and in Truth, where Souls truly accept of Chriſt on his own terms:) it is but weak, yea, ſadly clouded with doubts, and fears in many true Believers. As <hi>Cruciger</hi> on his Death-Bed, <hi>Invoco te quanquam languidâ &amp; imbecillâ fide, ſed fide ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> &amp;c. When a Soul hath let go its hold elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to take hold on Chriſt, yet many times it <hi>takes hold</hi> on him but with a <hi>trembling hand.</hi> That it is with a Believer, as with the four Lepers, 2 King. 7.3, 4. <hi>Why ſit we here till we dye? Let us go to the Syrians,</hi> if <hi>they ſave us, we ſhall live.</hi> As with <hi>Eſther,</hi> Chap. 4.16. <hi>I will go to the King. If

As one ſays, <q>There is a Faith that is called a <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi>

And indeed they have great <hi>cauſe to doubt</hi> of the truth of their Faith, that (as they ſay) <hi>never doubted</hi> of their Salvation in all their Lives.</p>
               <p>Yet further to lay down a few notes, whereby you may judg of your <hi>Affiance,</hi> and truſt in Chriſt, whether it be ſound, or no.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Sound <hi>Affiance</hi> in Chriſt is not without a <hi>ſelf-diſtruſt,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-deſpair. Haec vera hominis fiducia à

Have we received the <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> in our ſelves, <hi>not to truſt in our ſelves?</hi> Do we let go all <hi>broken Reeds,</hi> and forſake all falſe props? are we taken off our own bottoms, that we <hi>put no confidence in the Fleſh?</hi> Indeed Sinners are not ſo well inclined towards Chriſt, as to come to him, before a ſenſe of their neceſſity drive them. They come not, till they ſee they have none elſe to go unto, that all other <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge fails</hi> them. And ſo long as any are for <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> they are (it's true) like <hi>Paul,</hi> while he was a <hi>Phariſee</hi> (as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were Men that <hi>truſted in themſelves, that they were Righteous,</hi> Luk. 18.9.) but contrary to <hi>Paul,</hi> after he was a <hi>Convert,</hi> a Chriſtian, who then would be <hi>found in Chriſt, not having his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 3.9. In Hab. 2.4. A Soul that is <hi>lifted up,</hi> is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to one that <hi>lives by Faith.</hi> And I remember, One obſerves a more <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> betwixt <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than betwixt <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for (ſays he) Sin does <hi>accidentally drive us unto Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Self</hi> does altogether <hi>draw us from</hi> Chriſt. It is indeed a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal miſtake, for Men to aſcribe, and attribute that to their <hi>own works,</hi> or to any thing in themſelves, which is <hi>proper to God's Grace,</hi> or to <hi>Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Merits.</hi> If ever we be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we muſt ſee our ſelves loſt, and undone in our ſelves; and that we cannot be ſaved, but by Grace, in and through Jeſus Chriſt: that there is Salvation in no other.</p>
               <p>It is true, moſt certain, and unqueſtionable, that <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>The unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. So we cannot be ſaved without
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:92979:41"/>an inherent Righteouſneſs; yet we are not ſaved for it. This is a neceſſary <hi>qualification</hi> unto, not the <hi>procuring cauſe</hi> of Salvation.</p>
               <p>It was the carnal Jews overthrow (as we ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.) that they ſet up their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, confronting God's free Grace, and Chriſt's Merits.</p>

               <p n="2">2. A Sound <hi>Affiance</hi> in Chriſt is ever joyned with an <hi>hearty acceptance</hi> of him, and ſincere ſubjection to him. We cannot truly rely on Chriſt, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, while we refuſe and reject him, as Lord and King. He will not ſave any upon ſuch terms. But as <hi>Jeptha</hi> ſaid, <hi>If I deliver you, ſhall I be your Head? Non eſt hoc ingenium fidei</hi> (as <hi>Camero</hi>) this is not the diſpoſition and property of true Faith, to ſeparate Salvation from the <hi>means</hi> of Salvation.

               <p>They have very diſhonourable thoughts of God, that hope he will pardon them in a way of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.

And what unworthy thoughts have they of Jeſus Chriſt, that would make him the <hi>Miniſter of Sin,</hi> or a <hi>Patron,</hi> and encourager of Men in their Sins?</p>
               <p>As they were reproved, Mic. 3.11. for <hi>leaning on the Lord,</hi> when their doings were againſt the Lord: it is a great Sin, for any Man to <hi>rely on Chriſt</hi> to ſave him, who yet is in League with Sin, who

For this is not only to <hi>believe without</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (which is enough to ſhew the groundleſsneſs of it:) but alſo to <hi>believe contrary</hi> to the expreſs word of Chriſt (which further ſhews the great <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi> of it.) He has declared the contrary. Luk. 19.27. <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi> That all ſuch as love and live in Sin, and will not be ruled by the Laws of Chriſt, ſhould know, the Word aſſures them, that if they ſo continue, Chriſt will not ſave, but condemn them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Sound <hi>Affiance</hi> in God and Jeſus Chriſt for Salvation is uſually accompanied with <hi>a truſt,</hi> and dependance on the Lord, for <hi>temporal Mercies</hi> too, for what he ſees good for us here. As we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that, Joh. 3.12. <hi>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not; how ſhall ye believe, if I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:92979:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>tell you of heavenly things?</hi> If we have no Faith in the Promiſes concerning Temporals; how can we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Faith in thoſe of an higher Nature? Can we truſt the Lord for our Souls, and yet fear to truſt him for our Bodies? Do we truſt him to give us the everlaſting <hi>heavenly Inheritance;</hi> and yet dare we not truſt him for <hi>preſent maintenance?</hi> Do we depend on him, to raiſe our Bodies out of the Duſt at the laſt day, to a Life of Glory and Immortality; and yet have we no dependance on him, to ſupport us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or deliver us out of our troubles here? How ſtrange a thing were this?</p>
               <p>It is the ſame <hi>principle</hi> of Faith, that applies both Temporal, and Spiritual Promiſes: as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with the ſame Eyes beheld the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> and other common Objects.</p>
               <p>It is true, as Faith is not perfect in the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians, there are remainders of diſtruſt, which they cannot but oft diſcover in themſelves, and which they are aſhamed of and humbled for. Even <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, the <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> he that was ſo <hi>ſtrong in Faith,</hi> that having God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, could believe ſeeming impoſſibilities; yet was he ſometimes <hi>ſtaggering,</hi> through fear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.12, 13. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.2. But what ſhould ſuch think of themſelves, in whom <hi>diſtruſt is predominant?</hi> ſuch as are given up to diſtracting fears and cares concerning this Life? ſuch as yeild up themſelves to baſe, ſinful diſtruſt, without any reſiſtance? ſuch as are continually <hi>limiting</hi> God, and dare not take his Word, his <hi>Bond</hi> alone, but muſt have <hi>others bound</hi> with him, muſt always ſee a probability of the thing from ſecond cauſes? Such as whenever they are in any ſtrait, or trouble, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:92979:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>wait upon God,</hi> but are for <hi>making haſte,</hi> preſently betake themſelves to any ſinful ſhift, indirect cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, unlawful means to help and extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Such whoſe expectation is not from the Lord, nor their dependance on him concerning the things of this Life, how can it be thought, that they depend on him about their greateſt, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Concerns?</p>
               <p>Indeed if we are come to this, we ſhall not <hi>look</hi> ſo much <hi>at the things that are ſeen,</hi> as <hi>at the things that are not ſeen:</hi> We ſhall be chiefly taken up about our Spiritual, and Eternal State, and leſs regard Temporal things. Faith would <hi>ſhew us greater things than theſe.</hi> But how many (alas!) that venture their Souls, and while they care not what becomes of their Souls, or on what grounds they venture them, they fondly conceit, that they truſt God, and Chriſt with their Souls; while yet they have no truſt in God ſo much as for their outward Man: but are ſtill ſhifting for themſelves, without eying God's Will and Word, or Providence; or if they know not how to help themſelves, are preſently ſinking in deſpondency, and quite ſwallowed up with diſtruſtful fears, cares, and grief.</p>
               <p>Thus far of the ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> of Faith: Its proper, <hi>Elicit</hi> Acts.</p>
               <p>I ſhall further add a few <hi>Scripture-notes,</hi> whereby Saving-Faith may be known.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Where Faith is, Chriſt is <hi>precious.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you which believe he is precious.</hi> That which is called <hi>precious Faith,</hi> will teach us to account Jeſus Chriſt <hi>precious,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> of Chriſt <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:92979:44"/>
               <p>Thus to Believers the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt is precious. 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen, ye love.</hi> Believers that never ſaw him with their Eyes, yet believing him to be ſuch an one indeed, as he is ſet forth in the Word, they are exceedingly taken with him, they cannot but admire him. As the Spouſe in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> was at a loſs for expreſſions, high enough, to ſhew the lovelineſs, and excellency of her Beloved. After all that ſhe had ſaid in her deſcription of him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. ſhe thinks her ſelf very ſhort: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludes, ver. 16. <hi>Yea, he is altogether lovely.</hi> There is no true Believer, but has high admiring thoughts of Chriſt, ſees him to be the <hi>chiefeſt of ten thouſands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſuch his <hi>benefits</hi> are precious. The <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, how precious! 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. And how precious are the benefits purchaſed by his Blood! How do Believers prize <hi>a pardon!</hi> How do ſuch prize an Intereſt in Chriſt, counting all things but <hi>loſs and dung</hi> to that! The Graces, the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> how do they prize theſe above Riches, above the moſt <hi>precious Fruits</hi> of the Earth!</p>
               <p>The <hi>Love</hi> and Favour of Chriſt, how do ſuch prize it, far above the Favour and Friendſhip of the World. Lord, do thou <hi>ſmile,</hi> (will ſuch a Soul ſay;) and I can then be content, though the World do <hi>frown. Thy love is better than Wine,</hi> Cant. 1.2. Nothing in the World would ſo chear the Hearts of the Faithful. The <hi>preſence</hi> of Chriſt, Communion and Fellowſhip with Chriſt is highly prized of every believing Soul.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Name of Chriſt</hi> is precious unto ſuch, and thoſe things that bear his Name. <hi>His Day,</hi> the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> accounted of above all other Days.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:92979:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>His <hi>Ordinances</hi> are prized. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt as <hi>precious Ointment poured forth,</hi> Cant. 1.3. His Word more precious than Gold. His <hi>Promiſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding precious,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. And <hi>Prayer</hi> is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a precious Priviledg; even that we may <hi>ask the Father in his Name.</hi> Believers would not for a World be without this Priviledg. Thus Chiſt is precious to Believers, and all of Chriſt, his Perſon, his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, his Benefits, his Ordinances, all are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>But further, that you may not be miſtaken here, thinking that you prize Chriſt, when it may be, the Lord ſees, you are yet ſuch as diſpiſe him, take theſe two or three notes, to try your ſelves by.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If now Chriſt be precious to us, as he is to them that believe; then certainly, we are come to ſee our former <hi>vileneſs,</hi> when we had baſe, low, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thoughts of him, and when our carriage was nothing leſs, than a contempt of him. How oft was Chriſt, with all his precious benefits, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly offered to us in the Goſpel, while we did moſt unreaſonably, and ungratefully reject him? we <hi>would none of him.</hi> How long did we prefer the World, and our baſe Luſts before him? when we were called on to follow Chriſt, how ſhy, how backward have we been; as aſhamed of him, or having better thoughts of our old Maſters, the Luſts and Pleaſures we have ſerved, which we were loth to forſake for him? Oh, our Sin, and Folly, that ever we deſpiſed ſuch a precious Saviour! What a ſhame is this, that ever any of the Sons of Men ſhould be aſhamed of Chriſt? And what horrible vileneſs is this, for any of us to have baſe thoughts
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:92979:45"/>of Chriſt? And have not they baſe thoughts of Chriſt indeed, who prefer ſome baſe Luſt before him? Hath he deſerved to be ſo ſlighted, and ſet at nought? As he ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were ready to ſtone him, <hi>Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father, for which of thoſe works do ye ſtone me?</hi> What? After ſuch unparallel'd Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion as he hath ſhewn towards us poor, loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even when we were Enemies, ſhewed in ſuch a coſtly way, as that of his moſt wonderful humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, even to his dying a moſt painful, ſhameful, and accurſed Death for us, to purchaſe Pardon and Salvation for all that will accept him; ſhould we requite him ſo, even reject him, preferring his and our moſt deadly Enemies before him? Was ſo great folly, baſeneſs, and ingratitude ever heard of? Surely, if now we are come to ſee <hi>the worth</hi> of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and to prize him indeed, we cannot but be greatly aſhamed to think how we, for traſh and dung, have ſometimes trampled on that <hi>Pearl of greateſt price.</hi> Our former Sin, of making light of Chriſt, will now lye heavy; and we ſhall be deeply humbled for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If now Chriſt be precious to us, as he is to them that believe, then we have learnt to prize him <hi>above all things</hi> in the World. Pray obſerve this, we prize not Chriſt <hi>at all,</hi> till we prize him <hi>above all.</hi> You may perſwade your ſelves, Sirs, that you have very good thoughts, high thoughts of Chriſt, as you can ſpeak honourably of him: but if you do not really <hi>prize him above</hi> your Profits, your Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, your Credit, or Honour, or any thing you can have, or expect in the World, I muſt tell you, you do ſhamefully <hi>undervalue</hi> him. What low
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:92979:45"/>thoughts had <hi>Judas</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, who ſold him for <hi>thirty peices of Silver</hi> (the price of a Slave; as ſome have noted from <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.32. the loweſt price, that the vileſt of Men were rated at)? So do not they prize Chriſt at a goodly price, that prefer worldly things before him? Yea, ſuppoſe one to have an <hi>equal love,</hi> and <hi>eſtimation</hi> of Chriſt, to that he hath of worldly things (though indeed the <hi>Scales</hi> here are never <hi>even,</hi> never at an <hi>aequipoiſe,</hi> but the one or the other will weigh down; yet if that were ſo) it would not do. Chriſt is ſet too low, while any thing in the World is <hi>equalized</hi> to him, and ſuffered to ſtand in competition with him. Luk. 14.26. <hi>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſters, yea and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. [Hate not]</hi> comparatively. <hi>Loving</hi> in a <hi>leſs degree</hi> is ſometimes termed <hi>hating</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>hated Leah,</hi> loving <hi>Rachel</hi> much more, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.30, 31, 33. But it would not have agreed with <hi>Jacob's</hi> Piety, to have hated <hi>Leah,</hi> taking the word <hi>ſtrictly.</hi> And to hate natural Parents is <hi>unnatural,</hi> and impious; and to hate ones ſelf is <hi>againſt Nature,</hi> and impoſſible. That we muſt there underſtand a <hi>leſs degree of loving.</hi> And as Chriſt will be advanced above all the World in our Affection; ſo will he be preferred in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and <hi>eſtimation.</hi> Indeed how can we <hi>love</hi> him above all, if we do not <hi>prize</hi> him above all?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Chriſt be precious to us, then certainly we cannot endure to ſee, or hear Chriſt vilified, and diſhonoured. It will grieve us at Heart, to ſee this <hi>Pearl trodden under Foot.</hi> We could be more content
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:92979:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be vilified for him, than to ſee him contemned. How would it move us, to hear and ſee a ſpecial Friend, (whom we moſt highly eſteem) reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abuſed? As <hi>Jonathan</hi> was grieved for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, becauſe his Father had done him ſhame,</hi> 1 Sam. 20.34. That Chriſt is generally ſo lightly eſteemed, yea, ſo much diſhonoured in the World, and that many of ours make light of him, this will be very greivous to us, if indeed Chriſt be precious to us. And as <hi>Jonathan</hi> took <hi>David's</hi> part there, we ſhall be ready to plead for Chriſt. We would not have him deſpiſed of any, if we can help it. We would be commending him to others, and eſpecially to ours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Chriſt be precious in our account, we ſhall be reſtleſs, and <hi>unſatisfied,</hi> till we have in ſome good meaſure cleared up our <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and propriety in him. As the Apoſtle, Phil. 3.8. <hi>I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the Knowledg of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi> One that ſees how precious Chriſt is, cannot but earneſtly deſire to know further, that he is <hi>his Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>his Lord.</hi> A Believer who ſees <hi>his All</hi> bound up in Chriſt, <hi>(loſe Chriſt, and loſe all)</hi> how will he pray, ſearch, uſe diligence to have his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt evidenced, and made ſure? As if a Man's title to Houſe and Land, and all he had in the World be in queſtion, he would not reſt, till he had got his title cleared.</p>

As upon our <hi>firſt believing</hi> in Chriſt, and accepting of him, we are thereby intereſted in him, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, not only to be juſtified by his merit, but alſo <hi>to be ſanctified</hi> by his Spirit. As we are ſaid to <hi>receive the promiſe of the Spirit through Faith:</hi> Gal. 3.14. And Eph. 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo after that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ye were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> Indeed it is by the <hi>ſpecial influx,</hi> or operation of the Spirit, that a Man puts forth <hi>the Act</hi> of Faith at firſt; and upon this, the Spirit is further given, to <hi>dwell</hi> in him, or a principle of Grace, renewing, <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying habits</hi> are wrought in him, ſeated in his Soul, ſtill diſpoſing and inclining unto gracious Acts, to a life of Holineſs and Obedience. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to <hi>dwell in the Heart by Faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. He dwelleth in us by his Spirit. And it is Faith, that letteth in Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit into the Heart, to dwell there. Thus Faith <hi>uſhereth in</hi> the Spirit of Sanctification. And ſo, <hi>if any Man be in Chriſt</hi> (by Faith) <hi>he is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Gal. 5.6. with 6.15. In the former you have <hi>Faith;</hi> in the latter a <hi>new Creature.</hi> Thou art not a true Believer, if thou art not a <hi>new Creature.</hi>

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:92979:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And as we enter into a ſtate of Sanctification by Faith; So by Faith we make progreſs in it. As the Life, which the Apoſtle lived, after he came in to Chriſt, was <hi>by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. He was ſtill drawing vertue from Chriſt, and receiving of his fulneſs, even Grace for Grace. As Faith hath reſpect to the ſeveral parts of the Word, not only Doctrines and Promiſes, but Commands, and Threatnings too. So it hath an <hi>influence</hi> on all other Graces, and hath an hand in all acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that a Believer performs, as we ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Therefore if you would know, whether you have Saving-Faith, enquire ſeriouſly whether you are <hi>Sanctified by Faith.</hi> And to give you ſome help here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where Sanctifying Faith is, there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an outward, but an <hi>inward change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sanctifying-Grace is properly and <hi>immediately ſeated in the Soul,</hi> (as its <hi>Subject</hi>) and the Soul is <hi>really</hi> changed by it; though not as to its <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> yet as to its <hi>qualities.</hi> The Heart is new-moulded. There are new diſpoſitions, inclinations, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in the Soul. It acteth from a new <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and aimeth at other <hi>ends.</hi> The <hi>Body</hi> is not changed by Grace, either in ſubſtance, or quality, <hi>immediately:</hi> but being under the government of a Soul, that is ſanctified, and being a part of one, that is by Grace truly reſolved for God, and his Service, it will certainly be engaged, and uſed for God too, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſuch cannot be ſanctified, who are not ſo much as outwardly reformed. Such as were known to be common Swearers, Sabbath-breakers,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:92979:47"/>Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are ſo ſtill, one may pronounce them, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified.</hi> To be ſanctified, and to live, and continue in groſs known Sin, are eſtates directly oppoſite.</p>
               <p>Yet there may be an outward reformation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true Sanctification. Sanctification connotates a change of Heart, and Life both. Not a bare ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from the outward act of Sin; but a <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying</hi> of it, and a <hi>dying</hi> to it. Not a leaving it in <hi>practiſe</hi> only; but a forſaking it in <hi>affection</hi> too. That the Heart, which was <hi>ſet upon</hi> its Luſts, is now turned, and <hi>ſet againſt</hi> them: it now loaths what it was formerly in love with.</p>
               <p>Now is thy heart purified. Jer. 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, waſh thine Heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayſt be ſaved.</hi> It is not enough to have hands waſhed; but our Hearts muſt be cleanſed, if we would be ſaved. Pſal. 24.3, 4. <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the Hill of the Lord? He that hath clean hands, and a pure Heart.</hi> What is it to live free from groſs Sins, to be no Extortioner, Oppreſſor, Swearer, Drunkard, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to be like a <hi>whited Sepulchre,</hi> which appears beautiful outward, but within is full of all uncleanneſs? as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appeared righteous unto Men; but within were full of Hypocriſy and Iniquity? What is it for one to change his Life and Courſe; while his Heart and Mind is not changed? Though he that was given to Stealing, ſhould ſteal no more: and he that was given to Lying, Curſing, Swearing, ſhould no more Lye, or Curſe, or Swear: and he that was given to Tipling and Drinking, ſhould no more be intemperate; this will not prove a Man
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:92979:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sanctified. You may be <hi>civilized,</hi> and yet not <hi>ſanctified.</hi> For a Man to argue thus, I am not guilty of open profaneneſs, therefore I am a Saints; is no better arguing, than to reaſon thus, I have not the Plague, or Leproſy; therefore I am a Sound Man. But who knoweth not, that a Man may be Sick of diverſe other Diſeaſes, who is free from theſe? And may not one die of a Feaver, or Conſumption, though he have not the Plague?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we are ſanctified by Faith, there is not only a negative, but a <hi>poſitive change</hi> wrought in us. One that is Sanctified, hath put off the old Man, and <hi>put on the new.</hi> He may ſay, by the Grace of God I am not what I was ſometimes: and <hi>by the Grace of God I am what I am.</hi> He is not now what he was before: he is now what he was not before. Once he was Proud, Self-conceited: but now humble, ſelf-abhorring. Once very vain, and (it may be) profane: but now ſtrict, and ſerious. Once alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſelfiſh: but now ſelf-denying. Once he was (at leaſt in his Heart) an Enemy to the Power of Godlineſs, and perhaps a ſcoffer at Holineſs: but now a lover, and follower of what before he had ſo great a Prejudice and Antipathy againſt. Once he was very backward to Religious Duties, to the ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath, to the reading of the Word, to Family-Prayer, and ſecret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now his delight is in Holy Duties, and he could not live without them. Once his Heart was wholly ſet upon Sin, and the World: but now in a good meaſure weaned from the World, now reſolved and ſet againſt Sin, now ſet upon God, and Chriſt, ſet upon Holineſs, and Heaven and heavenly things.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:92979:48"/>
               <p n="3">3. If we are ſanctified by Faith, then there is a <hi>thorow change</hi> wrought in us. As the Apoſtle pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 Theſ. 5.23. <hi>The very God of Peace ſanctify you wholly — your whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature: old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become new. [Behold] q. d.</hi> this is a thing to be well obſerved. Sanctifying grace makes a great change indeed: Mark it. <hi>[Behold all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.]</hi> The new Creature hath a new Heart, a new Tongue, a new Life. The new Creature walks by a new Rule, is for new Deſigns, new Employment, new Company, new Delights.</p>
               <p>Sanctification is a <hi>renewing of the whole Man.</hi> As in our natural ſtate, corruption overſpreads the whole Man (for which reaſon it may be called the <hi>old Man;</hi>) So if we are ſanctified, Grace makes a change on the whole Man (for which cauſe it may be called the <hi>new Man;</hi>) though it makes not a perfect change here in this Life. The new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is renewed <hi>in every part,</hi> though he be renewed but <hi>in part,</hi> while here. He has a perfection <hi>of Parts,</hi> though not <hi>of Degrees.</hi> As a Child hath all the Parts of a Man, though not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mans Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As when Day breaketh, the whole Air is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enlightned, though not in that degree, as when the Sun is up, and ſhineth in its Strength. As Fire quickly enters all the Pores of the Iron, put into it; though it is not preſently red hot. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace worketh upon the Judgment, Will, Affections, upon the whole Soul, all its Powers and Faculties.</p>
               <p>And hence ariſeth a main difference betwixt the Conflicts of the Regenerate, and thoſe Conteſts
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:92979:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>which are in the Unregenerate. There is oft a <hi>great Conteſt</hi> in an Unregenerate Man betwixt his <hi>Conſcience</hi> convinced, and awakened, and his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Will,</hi> and vile <hi>Affections.</hi> Conſcience calleth him one way; while his Will, and Affections draw him a contrary way. But in the Regenerate there is warring in the <hi>ſame Faculties.</hi> As all the Faculties are renewed, though but imperfectly: Hence as the Twins (<hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>) ſtrove in <hi>Rebeckah's</hi> Womb; ſo there is <hi>Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> the remainders of Corruption, and a Principle of Grace ſtriving in every Faculty. Not only an enlightned <hi>Conſcience</hi> againſt Sin, but the habitual <hi>bent of the Will</hi> and Affections againſt it too. The renewed part of the Will and Affections, or to ſpeak more properly, that new <hi>gracious quality</hi> in the Will and Affections, againſt the Unregenerate part, or what remains of the old Man in them. And though that better Principle is ſometimes born down, through the impetuouſneſs of Temptation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet hence it is, that a Regenerate Man ſinneth not with <hi>full Will</hi> and <hi>Conſent,</hi> as he did, before he was Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
               <p>Again, Sanctifying Grace maketh a <hi>thorow change,</hi> turning the Soul from all Sin, <hi>to hate every falſe way.</hi> So that no Iniquity is regarded in the Heart. One that is Sanctified, is for cleanſing himſelf from all filthineſs, both of Fleſh and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, It makes a <hi>thorow change,</hi> inclining the Soul to Obedience unto the Will of God in all things; To have a <hi>reſpect to all God's Commands.</hi> An holy Rule, and an holy Heart do well agree. As the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 7.22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God, after the inner Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:92979:49"/>
               <p n="4">4. If we are Sanctified by Faith, we are for <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing progreſs</hi> in Holineſs, till we come to Perfection. As we may ſee natural things growing up to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in their kind, the <hi>Seed</hi> growing up to a flouriſhing <hi>Plant,</hi> the <hi>Set</hi> growing to a <hi>Tree,</hi> the <hi>Child</hi> growing till he becomes a <hi>Man:</hi> So Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace is of a growing nature. And though all that are Sanctified, are not of the ſame pitch and ſtature in Grace, yet all are endeavouring and breathing after Perfection. The leaſt Saint would be perfectly Holy, and the higheſt Saint cannot but ſee great imperfection in himſelf, and ſo is grieved, that he is no more Holy. Such never think they have <hi>Grace enough,</hi> while they may have <hi>more.</hi> But as for ſuch as cry up a mean in Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they need be no better than they are, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be no better, they that like to <hi>ſtand at a ſtay,</hi> are not right. Certainly there is no <hi>good Man,</hi> but deſires to be <hi>better than</hi> he is.</p>

                  </note> True Saving-Faith <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Love.</hi> Gal. 5.6. It <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> it begets <hi>Love,</hi> and it <hi>works by Love.</hi> Indeed Faith, and Love are two moſt <hi>active</hi> Principles that will ſet the Soul on work.</p>
               <p>How doth Faith beget Love?</p>
               <p>Why thus: As it perſwades the Soul of the <hi>love of God</hi> to us miſerable loſt ſinners, in giving his Son, his only begotten Son; and the <hi>love of Chriſt,</hi> in giving himſelf for us, for our Redemption. As it perſwades the Soul of the rich and free Grace of God, in offering his Son; and of Jeſus Chriſt, in offering himſelf to us, together with the greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits we can think of, or deſire, to make us for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:92979:50"/>happy. That ſuch things ſhould be done for, and offered unto ſuch undeſerving, and illdeſerving Creatures, that Chriſt, the Beloved, and only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, ſhould die for us Sinners, for Enemies, to reconcile us to God; and not only offer us a <hi>Pardon,</hi> written in his Blood; but a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> an <hi>heavenly Inheritance,</hi> purchaſed by his Blood, how admirably taking are ſuch expreſſions of Divine Grace and Love! Shall not ſuch <hi>love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us?</hi> 1 Joh. 4.10. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God: but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our Sins.</hi> And ver. 16. with ver. 19. <hi>We have known and believed the love that God hath to us. We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Suppoſe a condemned Traitor, that could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing but the ſtroke of Juſtice, and a ſhameful Death, ſhould yet have a <hi>Pardon</hi> offered him, under his Princes <hi>Hand and Seal,</hi> with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the greateſt Dignity and Promotion in the Court and Kingdom, that a Subject was capable of; if he would heartily acknowledg his offence, and faithfully promiſe Loyalty for the future: how would his Heart melt, as overcome of ſuch kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Clemency! But we may well ſay here, <hi>Is this the manner of Man, O Lord God?</hi> Is there any parallel to be found, or thought of, to the love of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, towards poor loſt Sinners? When <hi>David</hi> had ſpared <hi>Saul's</hi> Life, (1 Sam. 26.) how it wrought upon him? <hi>Is this thy Voice, my Son</hi> David? <hi>I will no more do thee harm, becauſe my Soul was precious in thine Eyes this day.</hi> But Faith will give us to ſee, that our Souls were much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the ſight of Chriſt, who gave himſelf a ranſome for them.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:92979:50"/>
               <p>Again, As Faith ſhews the Soul the wonderful, and matchleſs love of God and Chriſt to Sinners; ſo likewiſe it preſents God in Chriſt to the Soul, as the moſt <hi>deſirable Object</hi> in all the World, and the moſt worthy of Mans Love. By <hi>Faith</hi> Moſes <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as ſeeing him who is inviſible:</hi> and by Faith Souls <hi>fall in love.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. A ſight of God and Chriſt by Faith, will work love to him. Faith diſcovers the greateſt amiableneſs to be in him.</p>
               <p>And thus indeed there is <hi>ſome degree of love</hi> in the very <hi>firſt act of Faith,</hi> as ſaving. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive, that a Man ſhould accept of Chriſt without a deſire of him, without affecting and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, as a moſt ſutable Good. Though the <hi>Act of Aſſent</hi> be before the <hi>Love of Deſire;</hi> yet this Love ever goes along with the <hi>Act of Conſent</hi> and <hi>Acceptance.</hi> As one ſayes, <q>We do not accept,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
                     </note> or <hi>marry Chriſt firſt,</hi> and only <hi>love after:</hi> but lovingly accept him.</q> When we give up our ſelves to God, and Jeſus Chriſt to be ſaved by him in his appointed way, ſurely we have a liking of him, to whom we give up, and make over our ſelves. We muſt needs prefer him in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Will, in our deſire, and choice before all other.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Faith is not Saving, if it worketh not love; yea, if it doth not cauſe us to love God, and Jeſus Chriſt <hi>above all;</hi> ſo that we could forſake all for God, and Chriſt. And <q>the <hi>predominant love</hi> of God and Holineſs (as Mr.
<note place="margin">Cathol. Theol. <hi>Book,</hi> 1. <hi>Part.</hi> 2. §. 17. <hi>p.</hi> 91.</note> 
                     <hi>B.</hi> hath it) is the <hi>very Heart</hi> of the new Creature. And as Chriſt (as Mediator)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:92979:51"/>is the <hi>ſummary means</hi> and way to the Father, to bring Man home to his Creator; So Faith in Chriſt is a <hi>mediating Grace,</hi> to work in us the love of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then Faith <hi>worketh by Love.</hi> Indeed when this Love is kindled in the Heart, (it is a moſt powerful, a leading, and commanding Affection) it will work upon all the <hi>Affections.</hi> Then there will be <hi>grief,</hi> and ſorrow for having offended God, there will be <hi>fear</hi> of diſpleaſing him, an <hi>hatred</hi> of what is offenſive to him, a <hi>deſire</hi> to pleaſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, <hi>delight</hi> in his Service, and in ways of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
               <p>So Love will put a Man <hi>upon Action.</hi> This would make us active for God, to promote his Honour, and Intereſt. And his Commands would not be grievous to us. Yea, this would make us ready not only <hi>to do,</hi> but alſo <hi>to ſuffer</hi> for him. This would help us to hold out in a way of Obedience, and patient Suffering. If we love the Lord, we ſhall cleave to him with full purpoſe of Heart. But of the Grace of Love ſee more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p n="4">4. True Faith <hi>overcometh the World.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4, 5. <hi>This is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith. Who is he that overco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the World, but he that believeth?</hi> Faith is a <hi>victorious</hi> Grace, and every true Believer is a <hi>Conqueror.</hi> He is a greater Conqueror then <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> He obtaineth a better Victory, a more gainful, and glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the World.</p>
               <p>It is true, that Believers do not here obtain a full, and <hi>abſolute Conqueſt</hi> of the World. And

But as the more a Chriſtian is raiſed <hi>above the World,</hi> the more doth the Truth, and ſoundneſs of his Faith appear; ſo while a Man is at the Worlds command, and plainly captiv'd by it, he may know, that his Faith is not ſound, and ſaving.

               <p>The World indeed, as it is God's Creature, is to be loved, and uſed for him: But as Man's Corruption hath made an <hi>Idol</hi> of the World; as it is that wherein Men commonly place their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> as it is ſet in <hi>Competition</hi> with God and Chriſt, or ſet in <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> thus it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, renounced and crucified. Thus the World is an Enemy indeed; an Enemy that we did vow and <hi>covenant</hi> againſt in our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> when we were ſolemnly liſted into Chriſt's ſervice. It is a deadly Enemy; if we do not <hi>overcome</hi> it, it moſt certainly overcometh us; and a we ſhall fall and periſh by, and with the World. The Apoſtle hath told us plainly, <hi>That their End is Deſtruction, whoſe God is their Belly, and who mind earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3.9. And ſuch as are <hi>Lovers of Pleaſures, more than Lovers of God,</hi> have no more than an empty <hi>Form of Godlineſs, denying the Power thereof,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.4, 5. When Man fell from God, he fell to the Creature, he fell down to the World; and he cannot return to God, without being looſened from the Creature, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed above the World. While a Man reſts in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:92979:52"/>World, he ſtayeth at a <hi>broken Ciſtern,</hi> he neglects and forſakes God, the <hi>Fountain of living Waters.</hi> And <hi>how can ye believe which receive Honour one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</hi> Joh. 5.44. So ſuch cannot be ſound Believers, that are more for the World's favour, than for the favour of God. Such cannot be ſound Believers, that are more for carnal Pleaſures, than for ſpiritual, than for thoſe everlaſting Pleaſures at God's right-Hand; or are more for worldly Riches, than for Treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>True Faith would lay the World, and worldly Things, low in our eſteem, low in our thoughts. Faith judgeth of them by the Word; it weighteth them in the <hi>Ballance of the Sanctuary;</hi> it compares earthly and ſpiritual things, worldly and heavenly things, things temporal and things eternal together. Thus the World appears a vain, empty, worthleſs, baſe and contemptible thing indeed to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, not fit for him to ſet his heart upon, but to get <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.</hi>

               <p>An Unbeliever for want of Faith makes light of Chriſt, and his Benefits; makes light of a Crown of Glory, of Heavens Happineſs, revealed and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel.

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:92979:52"/>
               <p>But a true Believer (on the contrary) has a ſight of thoſe things within the <hi>Vail,</hi> by Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h. <hi>Faith is the Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Thus he hath found the hidden Treaſure, he has found the <hi>Pearl of great price,</hi> he has made a diſcovery of the <hi>good Land, that flows with Milk and Hony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is that <hi>Spy,</hi> that gives him certain intelligence of the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> He is put out of doubt of the infinite Treaſures that are in Chriſt, of that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy, and the everlaſting Pleaſures that are in God's Preſence in Heaven. Though <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; yet God hath revealed them to ſuch by his Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. The Spirit working Faith, gives the Soul a view of them. And hence it is, that worldly things appear to be but empty Bubbles, and meer Trifles, compared with ſpiritual things, with <hi>things above.</hi> Thus the World's Markets are marred with a Believer. He can no more value earthly things at the rate that Worldlings do. He is clearly convinced, that he ſhould be an <hi>infinite Loſer,</hi> if he ſhould throw away his Soul, and forgo all Intereſt in God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, for ſuch poor <hi>Commodities</hi> as theſe are. He knows where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his beſt and moſt ſerious Thoughts, his Heart and Affections better than on the World. He ſees worldly things to be valuable, only ſo far as they may help him forward in God's ſervice, and in Heavens way; but when they would be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, and <hi>pull-back,</hi> would be tempting him from Chriſt, would take him off from his Duty, from his main work and buſineſs of ſerving and glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and working out his own Salvation;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:92979:53"/>he looks upon them not only as vain <hi>Shadows,</hi> but as deadly <hi>Snares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well Sirs, Apply theſe things to your Hearts. While the World, either worldly Pleaſures, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bear greateſt ſway; while our Hearts and Affections are captivated by them, and our Lives ruled and governed by them, we do but vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Faith. The World loſeth its commanding Power, the World is in ſome meaſure conquered, and ſubdued, it is brought low, where Faith cometh.</p>
               <p>You have heard before, that a true Believer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts Chriſt precious; and here you ſee that he contemns the World. Indeed it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but look how much Chriſt is raiſed in a Man's eſteem, ſo much the World and worldly things go down.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True Faith <hi>overcomes a threatning,</hi> frowning, raging, ſtorming World. A ſound Believer will not forſake Chriſt, his Truth and Ways for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing the World can do, or threaten, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son. But the Fearful and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving — ſhall have their part in the Lake, which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone; which is the ſecond Death.</hi> Obſerve here, the <hi>fearful</hi> and <hi>unbelieving</hi> are oppoſed to him that <hi>overcometh.</hi> And the <hi>fearful</hi> and <hi>unbelieving</hi> are coupled together; <hi>predominant</hi> carnal <hi>Fear</hi> and true <hi>Faith</hi> are inconſiſtent. Such as are offended when Tribulation and Perſecution ariſe, ſuch as in time of <hi>Temptation fall away,</hi> were never ſound Believers.</p>
               <p>It is true, Sometimes in an hour of Temptation, a Believer is ſore ſhaken; but <hi>though he fall, he ſhall
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:92979:53"/>ariſe,</hi> and recover himſelf; as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and others. He may fall, but does not fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Again, it is true he may have many fears, that he ſhall not be able to hold out in the time of Trial; but he is ſafer for thoſe <hi>Fears</hi> that cauſe a godly <hi>jealouſy</hi> over himſelf, that quicken unto Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that keep him on his Watch. <hi>Self-ſuſpicion</hi> is a means to preſerve and ſecure the Soul, which <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence</hi> would betray and overthrow. But <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Fears</hi> (I grant) would ſhew Faith to be but weak; yet notwithſtanding a true Believer may have ſuch Fears, they are not <hi>predominant;</hi> ſtill he is kept by the Power of God, and kept through Faith.</p>
               <p>As <hi>by Faith Moſes</hi> refuſed the <hi>Honour</hi> of being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter, and refuſed the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of Sin, with the <hi>greateſt Treaſures</hi> in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> as he thus overcame a flattering World; ſo likewiſe by Faith he choſe to <hi>ſuffer Affliction with the People of God,</hi> and choſe Reproaches for Chriſt, and forſook <hi>Aegypt,</hi> not fearing the wrath of the King. Thus he alſo overcame a frowning and a raging World by Faith. And all true Believers have the ſame Spirit of Faith, though not in that <hi>heroical</hi> degree.</p>
               <p>And Faith will teach a Man to account upon Sufferings. All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer, muſt look to ſuffer in and from the World, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. A Man cannot follow Chriſt therefore, except he deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs.</p>
               <p>Again, Faith concludes, that Sin is far worſe than Suffering. That it is the greateſt Folly in the World, to run upon Divine Diſpleaſure, to avoid
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:92979:54"/>Man's Diſpleaſure. That the World cannot afflict any Torments on the faithful, like thoſe which God hath threatned, and will moſt certainly inflict on the faithleſs Apoſtates. <hi>Fire and Faggot</hi> is a light matter to that <hi>Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> which God hath prepared to be the portion of the <hi>fearful</hi> and <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further; Faith concludes, that <hi>all the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of this preſent time</hi> are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Glory that is to be revealed. That <hi>our light Afflictions which are but for a moment, ſhall work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Thus true Faith will help us to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World. If we have this Faith, then we are not of them <hi>who draw back unto Perdition; but of them that believe</hi> (and perſevere) <hi>to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Soul.</hi>

                  <hi>REpentance</hi> is not a more <hi>common</hi> than <hi>neceſſary</hi> Subject. It is <hi>part of the Foundation</hi> of Chriſtianity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. And without true Repentance, Mens <hi>hopes</hi> of Salvation are <hi>built on the Sand.</hi> I do not ſay, that any Man is ſaved <hi>for his</hi> Repentance; yet (ſpeaking of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult) we muſt ſay, that none are, or can be ſaved <hi>without</hi> it. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall periſh,</hi> Luk. 13.3, 5. <hi>Repent, and be Converted, that your Sins may be blotted out,</hi> Act. 3.19. without Repentance no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, no Remiſſion, and conſequently no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But what is this Repentance unto Life? And how may it be known?</p>
               <p>In the late <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> (chap. 15.) a good and full account is given of it, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>By it a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, out of the ſight and ſenſe not only of the <hi>danger,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>filthineſs</hi> and <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> of his Sins, as contrary to the Holy Nature, and Righteous Law of God, and upon the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Mercy in Chriſt to ſuch as are peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſo <hi>grieves</hi> for, and <hi>hates</hi> his Sins, as to <hi>turn from</hi> them all <hi>unto God,</hi> purpoſing and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:92979:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>to walk with him in all the wayes of his Commandments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> of Repentance is a <hi>Sinner,</hi> Mat. 9.13. <hi>I am not come to call the Righteous but Sinners, to Repentance.</hi> In <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> while Man retained his <hi>Innocency</hi> (which indeed was but a while) he had <hi>no need</hi> of Repentance. <hi>In Heaven</hi> the Saints are made Perfect in Holineſs, and ſo have <hi>no more occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for Repentance. The Subject of Repentance is a Sinner. Yea, <hi>a Sinner of ſome hopes. In Hell</hi> (a place full of Sin, as ever it can hold) there is no hope of obtaining Pardon, or finding Mercy, and ſo <hi>no place</hi> for Repentance. Hell, that is full of Deſpair, has no place for Repentance. Only <hi>upon Earth,</hi> as there is <hi>no Man that liveth and ſinneth not;</hi> and as God hath graciouſly promiſed pardon to all that truely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, here is both an <hi>engagement</hi> upon Sinners, and <hi>encouragement</hi> for Sinners to Repent.</p>
               <p>Some go further, and make the Subject of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a <hi>believing Sinner.</hi> Suppoſing that Faith (in <hi>order of Nature</hi>) goes before Repentance. As I conceive, the principle or habit of Faith, and of Repentance, and other, Graces are infuſed together. But by the ſpecial help, and operation of God's Spirit, the Soul <hi>is firſt</hi> inabled to put forth a <hi>gracious act,</hi> in conſenting to the terms of Gods Covenant, actually cloſing with, and accepting of Chriſt, as he is there offered; <hi>upon which</hi> the Spirit of Grace is given, to dwell in the Heart, gracious habits are implanted in the Soul, as a new nature inclining it to ſuch acts, (Which I could wiſh added to what I have written in a former Treatiſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. <hi>p.</hi> 224, 225.)</p>
               <p>Now though the <hi>general aſſenting Act</hi> of Faith muſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:92979:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to go before Repentance, as it is in the <hi>Will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cathol. Theol. lib. 1. par. 2. p. 84.</note> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> noteth) yet a Man cannot tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept of Chriſt as a <hi>perfect Saviour,</hi> without a ſenſe and <hi>feeling of the burthen</hi> of his Sins, and being humbled under it; nor can he accept of Chriſt <hi>as Lord and King,</hi> without a <hi>reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> and <hi>hearty purpoſe</hi> of turning from all Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. That in the very <hi>firſt act</hi> of Faith, as ſaving, there is Repentance alſo included.</p>
               <p>Repentance may be thus diſtinguiſhed; 1. It is either <hi>initial,</hi> or <hi>continued. Initial</hi> Repentance at a Man's firſt Confeſſion: <hi>Continued,</hi> that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows through the courſe of ones Life afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>virtual</hi> Repentance, a Diſpoſition or Inclination to mourn for, and turn from all our Sins, as we come to have our Sins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to us. And <hi>actual formal</hi> Repentance, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally grieving at, loathing, reſolving and ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sins we have found out, and are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an <hi>ordinary Repentance,</hi> daily practiſed for daily ordinary failings; and a ſpecial <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Repentance,</hi> exerciſed upon ſome foul Fall, ſad Declining, or Backſliding, as in <hi>David</hi>'s, and in <hi>Peter</hi>'s caſe. <hi>Renewed Repentance,</hi> as ſome call it, in regard of ſome ſad Interruption before. Yet theſe Diſtinctions do not imply <hi>various kinds</hi> of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but only different <hi>degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two main <hi>eſſential conſtitutive Parts</hi> of true Repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> Humiliation, and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Converſion:</hi> A <hi>mourning</hi> for Sin after a godly ſort, (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Poenitet;</hi> all ſhew Repentance to have Grief, and Sorrow in it. A Man that grieves not for what he hath done amiſs, repents not. Yea, there is no right forſaking of Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an hearty Sorrow for it. There is a <hi>Rending of the Heart for Sin,</hi> before it is <hi>rent from Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall a Man know, whether his Sorrow for Sin be right?</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Right Sorrow for Sin is upon <hi>right Grounds.</hi> As the Lord ſays, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have not cried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me—when they howled upon their Beds.</hi> And <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me?</hi> So there are many that cry out of their Sins, are troubled about their Sins, that yet do not ſorrow after a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſort, but have reſpect only to themſelves. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are troubled for Sin, not as <hi>contrary to God,</hi> but only as miſchievous or injurious to themſelves; not as it <hi>diſhonoureth</hi> God, but as it brings ſhame, and diſgrace upon themſelves; not as it diſpleaſeth God, but as it ſubjecteth them to his Wrath and Curſe; not as God is offended by it, but as they are like to ſuffer for it. Many only reſpect the Shame or Puniſhment felt or feared. Now that <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which comes only from Pride, cannot be ſound Humiliation. And that Sorrow which is meerly from <hi>ſelf-reſpect,</hi> cannot be <hi>godly Sorrow.</hi> Hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would ſometimes confeſs his Sin under the ſence of an heavy Plague; ſo wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> could <hi>humble</hi> himſelf under the fear of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned, while far enough from true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:92979:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And as there is a Principle of <hi>ſelf-love</hi> planted in all Men, the wickedſt Man on Earth would not be miſerable for ever, is not willing to be damned. And ſo when a Sinners Conſcience is awakened, that he ſees himſelf obnoxious to God's everlaſting Wrath, and to the torments of Hell for ever; no wonder if he be full of horror. Nature only (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt dram of Grace) would teach one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch terrors, to cry out (with <hi>Judas</hi>) Oh! <hi>I have ſinned!</hi> Thus a Sinner under Convictions may have ſtronger <hi>paſſionate Workings</hi> of Grief, than gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls have ordinarily. The <hi>Paſſion of Grief</hi> may be very much ſtirred, when yet there is no god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sorrow. Though I grant, it is lawful to be troubled for Sin, as it is againſt our ſelves. But if we are troubled for Sin only as againſt our ſelves, not as againſt God: ſuch Trouble is privatively ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Godly Sorrow is not only form <hi>Self-love,</hi> but from the <hi>Love of God</hi> and Chriſt and Holineſs. <q>Now, do we grieve for Sin, not only out of a Sight and Sence of the Danger, but alſo of the Filthineſs and Odiouſneſs of it, as contrary to the holy Nature and righteous Law of God?</q> Do we indeed grieve for Sin as Sin? More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do we mourn for Sin, as a <hi>Breach of God's holy Law?</hi> As it is a thing forbidden, and not only as it has ſet us under the threatnings of the Law. Do we heartily approve of the Law of God, as holy, juſt and good? Do we delight in the Law of God in the inner Man? Is it our earneſt Deſire, that our Hearts and Lives were in all things conformed to it? and our great grief to find the contrary? Many that ſometimes have ſtorms raiſed in their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:92979:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>Conſciences, but inſtead of being offended and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with themſelves, and their Sins, they are offended at the Word that diſcovers and condemns their Sins: and (as <hi>Ahab</hi> hated <hi>Micaiah</hi>) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure faithful Miniſters that tell them plainly of their Sins. If it be thus with thee, and if thy Heart riſeth againſt and repines at the ſtrictneſs and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God's Laws, if they are grievous to thee (as croſſing thy beloved Luſts) grievous as the Light to a Thief, or as Chains are to a Malefactor. Though thou mayeſt be full of Trouble and Perplexity, yet certainly it is quited different from true Repentance, and godly Sorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do we mourn for Sin as a <hi>Diſhonour</hi> to God? Herein lieth the greateſt Evil of Sin, that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. It is a <hi>practical</hi> Denial, Contempt, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting or Abuſing of God, and of all God's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; a Denial or Contempt of his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Authority, of his Holineſs and Juſtice, of his Wiſdom, Truth, Power and Greatneſs, of his Omnipreſence, Omniſcience, of his Dominion and Propriety in his Creatures, an abuſe of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is a denying him that Honour, Service and Subjection, which is due from us as we are his Creatures. Indeed it cannot be expreſſed what a wrong and diſhonour to God Sin is. And this a gracious Soul takes notice of in his ſad Reflections upon his Sins: As <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.13. <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight.</hi> Though he had ſinned againſt others too, had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> depriving her of her Chaſtity, had ſinned againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> depriving him of his Life; had ſinned againſt the World, ſetting it ſo
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:92979:57"/>ill an example, and giving Enemies ſuch occaſion to blaſpheme; theſe wrongs did all terminate upon God, the ſupream <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> and the Injury done to Creatures, (though great in it ſelf) was a ſmall matter to the Wrong and Diſhonour therein done to God. As the Lord, to magnify his Grace in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the Sins of his People, goes over with it again and again <hi>[againſt me, againſt me]</hi> Jer. 33.8. <hi>I will cleanſe them from all their Iniquities, whereby they have ſinned againſt me: and I will pardon all their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities, whereby they have ſinned againſt me, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> So that Sin is againſt God, this is the burthen of every gracious Heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do we grieve for Sin as it <hi>diſpleaſeth</hi> God, as it is the abominable thing <hi>which he hateth.</hi> Ezek. 6.9. <hi>They that eſcape of you ſhall remember me among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe I am broken with their whoriſh Heart, which hath departed from me,</hi> &amp;c. Doth this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Sin break our Hearts? Are we vexed at our ſelves, that we have fretted him, (as we have the Expreſſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.43.) that we have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſquieted him? Doth it grieve us to think how we have grieved his Spirit? Is it the burthen of our Souls to think how he is <hi>preſſed under our Sins,</hi> how we have wearied him with our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? It is nothing for us to be troubled, when God afflicteth and putteth us to grief. A Slave will roar and cry out under the Laſh. But an ingenuous Child is grieved when he hath diſpleaſed his Father, though he be not ſcourged and corrected for it. So though we are not chaſtened by God, yet do we <hi>afflict our own Souls</hi> for Sin? Or, if the Lord doth lay Affliction on our loyns, yet are we more troubled
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:92979:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>for having offended God, than for our own ſmart and ſuffering?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do we grieve for Sin, as <hi>againſt God's mercy?</hi> as an ill Requital of his Goodneſs? Doth the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God <hi>lead us to Repentance?</hi> Godly Sorrow is ingenuous. And the Mercy and Goodneſs of God is a ſpecial means of exciting to Repentance, and of promoting it.</p>
               <p>That there is Mercy with the Lord, that there is Hope of finding Mercy; this is a ſpecial means of working Repentance at firſt, without which the Soul would be ſwallowed up in deſpair. The Law diſcovering Sin and Wrath, diſplaying God's Holineſs and punitive Juſtice, may (in one ſence) <hi>break the Heart</hi> of a Sinner. But it is the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing God's free and infinite Grace and Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, his willingneſs and readineſs to pardon, and to be reconciled to Sinners that repent and turn; that is the means of melting the Heart into kindly Sorrow. The great Motive to ſound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is God's Mercy. As you find it laid down, Joel 2.13. <hi>Rent your Heart, and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs.</hi> When a Man conſidering his many and great Provocations on the one hand, and God's gracious and merciful Offers on the other hand. As <hi>[Thou haſt played the Harlot with many Lovers, yet return unto me, ſaith the Lord. As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye dye? Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:92979:58"/>him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.]</hi> When thus a Man hath his Heart relenting, it is kindly. When the thoughts of God's Goodneſs, of his gracious Nature, and his gracious Offers, cauſe a Man to loath himſelf, to be aſhamed of his own baſeneſs and vileneſs, in offending ſo gracious a God; this is godly Sorrow.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is an hopeful Sign, when the Heart is melting under common Mercies. A <hi>Stone-wall</hi> will ſeem to weep in moiſt weather: So the Hearts of many that are as hard as Stone, will ſeem to give again under Judgments. But <hi>David</hi> was brought to Repentance, by <hi>Nathan</hi>'s recounting God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours vouchſafed to him, and not only his denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing judgment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7, 8, with <hi>v.</hi> 13. And ſo ſome paraphraſe upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Againſt thee,</hi> who haſt done ſo much for me; <hi>againſt thee,</hi> who haſt ſo raiſed me, ſo oft delivered me.</q> O I have ill requited thee. The common <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, his Patience and Long-Suffering ſhould lead Sinners to Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. eſpecially conſidering the proper tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof. For though eventually, <hi>per accidens,</hi> through Mens wickedneſs that deſpiſe and abuſe Divine Patience and Long-Suffering, many a man's Condemnation is increaſed and aggravated thereby; yet <hi>per ſe,</hi> in its own nature, the <hi>Long-ſuffering of the Lord is Salvation,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.15. This gives us time and ſpace for <hi>Repentance,</hi> and for working out our Salvation; as there <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>The Lord is long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> As alſo it is a Motive to Repentance. God's forbearance and long-ſuffering preacheth and preſſeth to Repentance,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:92979:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>proclaiming God's unwillingneſs to puniſh, <hi>his waiting to be gracious,</hi> his waiting for the Sinners return. Thus I ſay, God's common Goodneſs and Patience exerciſed towards Sinners is to lead them to Repentance.</p>
               <p>And much more ſhould his <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour vouchſafed to his People, promote their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.60, 61, 62. And when it is thus, that the greater Senſe and Experience we have of God's Goodneſs, Grace and Mercy, the better thoughts we have of God, and the worſe thoughts we have of our Sins, and of our ſelves for Sin. When we bluſh, and are humbled, and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greatly, to think how we have requited the Lord <hi>evil for good;</hi> when by God's mercies we are brought to a loathing of our ſelves for our Iniquities: this is child-like and ingenuous; this is a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evidence that our Sorrow is after a godly ſort.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Do we mourn for Sin, as that <hi>for which Chriſt ſuffered?</hi> In <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. Where the Spirit of <hi>Grace and Mourning</hi> is promiſed to be poured out upon the Church and People of God, It is ſaid, <hi>And they ſhall look upon me whom they have peirced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only Son.</hi> &amp;c. That theſe Words have reference to Chriſt, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>John</hi> 19.37. The <hi>Garden,</hi> where Chriſt was in his bitter and bloody Agony, and Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> where he was crucified, are Schools, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould go in our ſerious Meditations, to learn to mourn for Sin. Now are our Hearts ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Blood of Chriſt? Do the thoughts of a bleeding crucified Saviour ſet our Hearts a bleeding for Sin? A gracious Soul ſees more of the <hi>evil of Sin</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:92979:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>in what Chriſt ſuffered, than in all that ever he himſelf ſuffered, or can ſuffer by it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Do we mourn for Sin, as <hi>defiling,</hi> as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Soul? As it is contrary to <hi>God's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> (the <hi>Beauty</hi> of the Soul, that which was, and would be Mans chiefeſt excellency) as it renders us unlike to an Holy God? Many can be troubled in reſpect of <hi>the guilt</hi> of Sin, as it expoſeth to Wrath, bindeth over to puniſhment, who are not troubled for the <hi>Pollution,</hi> and filthineſs that is in Sin. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could cry out of the Plagues, that his Sin had brought upon the Land, yet was not ſenſible of the <hi>Plague of his own Heart.</hi> A gracious Soul groaneth under, and is ſadly burthened with his corruptions, and ſinful imperfections, even when he may know that in and through Chriſt he is freed from Condemnation. He is ſick of Sin, weary of it, as one would be of filthy, noiſom Cloaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. He cannot but with the <hi>Leper,</hi> cry out, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean:</hi> And as <hi>Job, Behold, I am vile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Do we grieve for Sin, as the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of the Soul? as that which diſableth us from ſerving God as we ought? that greatly indiſpoſeth us to that which is good? Are we weary of Sin, as the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his <hi>Shackles?</hi> as the ſick Man of his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Do we mourn for Sin, as the <hi>partition-wall</hi> betwixt God and Souls? as that which eſtrangeth us from God, and God from us? Carnal Men can be troubled, when their Iniquities ſeparate betwixt them, and good things here: but ſuch as ſorrow after a godly ſort, ſee far more evil in Sin, as it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth betwixt God, and Souls. They are oft
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:92979:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>thinking, how they might enjoy more of God's gracious Preſence, were it not for their Sins. As, what is it but Sin that hinders our Communion with God? Gracious Souls oft think, how they might be refreſhed with the <hi>Light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> but that their Iniquities (like <hi>Clouds</hi>) are ſtill interpoſing. And this is Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when indeed Souls are <hi>lamenting after the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus let us examine, what are the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of our Sorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Godly Sorrow may be known by its <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs,</hi> and <hi>adequateneſs</hi> unto the <hi>Object,</hi> if we do not make light of any Sin, that we know, and are convinced of. There are many Sins, which others lightly paſs over, and make nothing of, which a gracious Heart is deeply ſenſible of, and truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A gracious Soul is humbled for <hi>original</hi> Sin, as well as for <hi>actual</hi> Tranſgreſſions. Such an one lays to Heart the Sin of his <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as his <hi>perſonal</hi> Sins. Indeed his actual Sins lead him to take notice of, and mourn over original Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As when <hi>David</hi> came to confeſs his great Sin of Blood-guiltineſs, he traced it to the <hi>Fountain-head,</hi> his being <hi>ſhapen in Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. As <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out, Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death!</hi> Such ſee their birth-Sin to be the Womb of all other Sins. They cannot make light of natural Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence ſo many impure Freams of actual Tranſgreſſions iſſue; the <hi>Root</hi> of Bitterneſs which bringeth forth ſo much poiſonous, and deadly Fruit.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:92979:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Now what ſhould ſuch think of themſelves, who were never humbled for that <hi>ſinning Sin,</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſenſible of the Corruption of their Natures? Who will not believe, that their <hi>Natures</hi> are ſo bad? Who bear up themſelves with this, that they have <hi>as good Hearts</hi> towards God, as the beſt, while yet their Hearts were never changed.</p>
               <p>And how little are they ſenſible of the evil of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Corruption,</hi> who when Sin hath ſhamefully broken out, when they have been unreaſonably tranſported with Paſſion, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> think to excuſe the matter, ſaying, Alas, they cannot help it, it is <hi>their Nature.</hi> But was <hi>Nabal</hi> ever the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for being of ſuch a churliſh Nature, that a Man could not ſpeak to him? Sure, they are not duly humbled for the Corruption of their nature, who take this for an <hi>Apology,</hi> or excuſe. Is it not ſo much the worſe, that the Nature of the <hi>Wolf</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous, and the Nature of the <hi>Toad,</hi> or <hi>Serpent</hi> is poiſonous? So that we are naturally prone to Sin, it is no extenuation, but an aggravation of our ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Gracious Soul is for <hi>laying load</hi> of Sorrow upon its <hi>ſpecial Sin.</hi> Such Sins whereby the Spirit is moſt grieved, and Communion with God moſt obſtructed, and growth in Grace moſt hindered, muſt needs be moſt grievous to a gracious Heart, as they are found out.</p>
               <p>Others may be ready to confeſs, and ſeem trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for common failings, ſuch Sins as the beſt of Men in this ſtate of imperfection are not freed from: but there is ſome <hi>ſpecial Sin,</hi> or other that they are wedded unto, and in league with, and this they ſeek to hide, palliate, and excuſe, all they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:92979:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>can; whether it be Pride, or Senſuality, Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that that is a Mans ſpecial beloved Sin, a natural Man is for cloaking that Sin, and cannot endure to hear his <hi>Herodias</hi> ſpoken againſt; he ſtudies Evaſions and Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to defend that Sin, and to put off Convictions. Thus the natural Man and Hypocrite will beat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Buſh. I remember Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> compares the Confeſſions of ſuch to the <hi>Cries of the Lapwing.</hi> As the <hi>Lapwing</hi> will cry and flutter, and make moſt ado, when furtheſt from her Neſt, or from her <hi>Young:</hi> So ſuch whoſe Hearts are unſound, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sins they take notice of, yet they uſe to keep aloof off from their <hi>ſpecial Sins.</hi> But the <hi>Doves of the Valleys,</hi> they mourn every one for <hi>his Iniquity, Ezek.</hi> 7.16. And this is a good Sign, when a Mans ſowreſt looks are on his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> his darling-Sin.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Godly Sorrow is not only moved for open miſcarriages, which others may take notice of; but is alſo ſtirred and working upon ſecret Sins. As <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid, Gen. 38.23. <hi>Let her take it to her, leſt we be ſhamed.</hi> Many would bluſh to have their Sins diſcovered, who are not troubled while they can keep them cloſe under-board. If they have been guilty of lying, and are found out, or guilty of ſome theft or wrong done to their Neighbour, and it is brought to light, then they are vexed and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>The Thief is aſhamed when he is taken.</hi> But might they have gone on in Sin undiſcovered, it would not have troubled them. That cannot be Godly Sorrow, where there is no reſpect unto God. And there is no reſpect unto God, where ſecret Sins are not a Burden. God ſees in ſecret. <hi>He ſets our ſecret
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:92979:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sins in the light of his Countenance.</hi> And ſo if we have godly Sorrow, we ſhall take notice of, caſt a ſorrowful Eye even on our ſecret Sins. As it is more, that God knoweth and is diſpleaſed at them, than if they were known to all the World.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Godly Sorrow is ſtirred in a ſenſe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Impurities,</hi> and not only moved at ſome groſs <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality.</hi> Natural Conſcience may fly in a Mans face for groſſe Sins (though ſecretly and cloſely committed): Sins that defile the Hands, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the Body, <hi>ſtare</hi> a Man in the Face, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo eaſily look off from them. The <hi>filthineſs of the Fleſh</hi> diſquiets the Conſcience of many a natural Man; while he is not ſenſible of the <hi>filthineſs of his Spirit,</hi> he quite overlooks other Sins ſeated within; that defile the Heart and Soul. But a gracious Soul is burdened with Unbelief, ſpiritual Pride, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, with the inward Diſtempers of his Spirit; yea many times he obſerves and is humbled for the <hi>firſt riſings</hi> of Corruption, firſt Motions to Sin.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Godly Sorrow is moved, as upon a ſenſe of the prevalence and ſtirring of Corruption, ſo upon a ſenſe of the Souls being ſo wanting and weak in Grace. A natural Man will complain, when his Conſcience is like a raging Sea, for want of Peace; while he complains not that his Heart is like a <hi>dead Sea,</hi> he is not troubled for the want of Grace. He could pray with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 51.9. <hi>Hide thy face from my Sins:</hi> but not go on with the Pſalmiſt, ver. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> Or if he prayeth for a clean Heart, an holy Heart, it is without Heart.

But the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul is weary of Sin, Sin is its greateſt Burden. He ſees a beauty in Grace and Holineſs, is taken with it, and is aſhamed to ſee himſelf ſo ſhort here. Like him that cried out with tears, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou mine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> He deſires indeed to love God, and is aſhamed that he loveth God no more. He would prize Jeſus Chriſt, and is grieved that he prizeth Chriſt no higher. He is grieved for Sin, and this further is his trouble, that he can grieve no more. He follows after Holineſs, and mourns to think that his Heart and Life are no more holy.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) A gracious Soul is humbled for the <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his holy Things.</hi> When others are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their formal, heartleſs Services: he ſees cauſe to be aſhamed of his beſt Performances, is troubled for ſinful defects in his beſt Duties. As the Church confeſſeth, <hi>Our Righteouſneſſes are as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Rags.</hi> As <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he had ſhewn great Zeal for God and his Service, yet prayed, Neh. 13.22. <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and ſpare me according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> Others reſt in the <hi>Work done,</hi> when they do Duties they care not how, indeed <hi>take God's Name in vain,</hi> yet they think they thereby make God their Debtor. Like thoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. who ſaid, <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not? wherefore have we afflicted our Souls, and thou takeſt no knowledg?</hi> As if the Lord did them wrong, if he did not take notice of them,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:92979:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>and reward them. A gracious Soul ſees need of much Incenſe, (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.) to perfume the beſt Prayers and Services, that ever he preſenteth unto God. And it is God's <hi>free-grace,</hi> that theſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as well, that his Tranſgreſſions and Sins are pardoned. Yea, ſuch a Soul is more troubled and afflicted in Spirit, that he prayeth ſo weakly, with ſo little Faith and Fervency; than others are for not praying, for their many ſad and ſinful Omiſſions of the Duty. He is more troubled for hearing no better, with no more reverence, and <hi>trembling at the Word;</hi> than others for their often <hi>turning away their Ear</hi> from the Word.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) A gracious Heart is ordinarily touched with a ſenſe of the <hi>leaſt Sins.</hi> Others may be troubled for great Enormities: but ſuch a Soul would not make light of the leaſt Infirmities. Indeed no Sin is to be called or accounted little <hi>poſitively,</hi> and abſolutely; but only <hi>comparatively.</hi> There is not the leaſt Sin, but deſerveth Death: and can that be a ſmall matter that deſerveth Death? Yet ſome Sins are more hainous, deſerving a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and a ſorer Puniſhment. But it is with a <hi>tender Heart,</hi> as it is with the <hi>Eye</hi> (that tender part) a ſmall Mote in the Eye offends it, and makes it run over. So not only groſs Sins, but leſſer Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, will grate ſore on a tender Heart. It is oft ſmitten for vain thoughts, idle words, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in following lawful Employments, a little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the uſe of Creature-Comforts, or outward Recreations, ſuch things as others account <hi>venial Matters,</hi> yea think it a fooliſh nice ſcrupuloſity for one to be troubled at. <hi>John Huſſe</hi> the Martyr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed his playing at <hi>Cheſs,</hi> (not that he accounted it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:92979:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>unlawful in it ſelf, but) as it had been an Occaſion of ſtirring up Paſſion, and of too great an Expence of precious time.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) A gracious Heart is humbled even for unknown Sins. As <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid, <q>Every Man hath two heaps of Sins,

We find ſuch, very ready to bear falſe witneſs againſt themſelves; ſometimes fancying, they had made a Contract, and were in League with the Devil; ſometimes concluding they had ſinned the unpardonable Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but groundleſly. Thus in ſome particular reſpects, a Man may think worſe of himſelf than he is, he may conclude ſome things to be Sins which he hath done, which the Law of God forbiddeth not; or he may imagin he hath committed this or that Sin, which indeed he has not committed: but it is an Error in his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to think ſo. Yet thus far there is a Ground for what Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſays. 1. That there is more <hi>Evil</hi> in Sin than we can apprehend. We cannot fully conceive what evil there is in it, and how vile we are in our ſelves by reaſon of it. 2. There is that Depth of Sin and Deceit in our Heart, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9.) which we are not able juſtly to fathom: and that multitude of Errors and Deviations in our Lives,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:92979:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>which we are never able to ſum up, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.) Thus they that know moſt of themſelves, who are at moſt pains in ſearching and trying their ways, muſt conclude after their moſt diligent ſearch, that there are many more Sins which the Lord could charge them with, which they could never yet find out and diſcover. And this is matter of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Some may ask, How ſhould one be troubled for <hi>unknown</hi> Sins? <hi>What the Eye ſees not, the Heart rues not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, a Man cannot grieve for them <hi>particularly,</hi> unleſs they were particularly known. But beſides the <hi>habit</hi> of Godly Sorrow in a gracious Heart, inclining the Soul to repent of any ſuch Sins <hi>in particular,</hi> as any of them are brought to ones knowledg, or remembrance; there is ofttimes alſo an <hi>actual</hi> ſorrowing for them in <hi>general.</hi> The gracious Soul queſtioneth not, but he hath more Sins, than he knoweth of, and as he cannot but pray (with the Pſalmiſt) to be <hi>cleanſed</hi> from thoſe <hi>ſecret Sins,</hi> which are not only concealed from others, but lye hid alſo from himſelf; ſo he cannot but grieve oft to think, that beſides all the Sins he ſeeth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, there are many more, which he ſees not. As if a Man concludes, he hath ſome great Diſtemper hanging on him, he will be troubled, though he know not his Diſeaſe in particular. Thus when others are hardly brought to any Sorrow for the Sins which they cannot but know themſelves guilty of, a gracious Soul is humbled to think, there is much more amiſs in the frame of his Heart, and courſe of his Life, than he is aware off. He hath many ſad thoughts of Heart even for his unknown Sins.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:92979:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="9">(9.) I may add, A gracious Soul is inclined to mourn, not only for his own Sins, but alſo for the <hi>Sins of others. Pia eſt illa triſtitia alienis vitiis inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcere, non adhaerere: contriſtari, non implicari: do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore contrahi, non attrahi.</hi> Aug. If we mourn for our own Sins <hi>with reſpect unto God,</hi> we ſhall be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at others Sins alſo, as being againſt God. Sin is a <hi>ſad ſight</hi> to one that is truly Gracious, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſees it. And moſt ſad, to ſee it in thoſe whom he loves moſt, in near <hi>Relations:</hi> or to ſee Sin growing common, and National, as thus God is more diſhonoured. But they that <hi>rejoyce in Iniquity,</hi> and are <hi>puffed up</hi> and pleaſe themſelves to ſee others worſe than themſelves, are not truly ſenſible of the evil of Sin.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how Godly Sorrow may be known by its <hi>extenſiveneſs,</hi> as to the Object.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Right Humiliation, and Godly Sorrow is <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>voluntary.</hi> Here many are meerly <hi>paſſive.</hi> Their Sorrow is forced, preſſed from them. It is only from the <hi>laſh</hi> on their Backs, or from the <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of God's dreadful Comminations <hi>flying in their Faces,</hi> or the Flaſhes of Hell Fire in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. They are afflicted in their Conſciences, when they do not deſire to afflict their own Souls for Sin. They have <hi>wounded Conſciences;</hi> not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and <hi>contrite Hearts. A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18.14. A wounded Spirit is a <hi>grievous burthen:</hi> a contrite Spirit is not ſo. When did you know one crying out of this? When others are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſee their Sins, as they would be affrighted at the <hi>Apparition</hi> of a deceaſed Friend; one of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Heart would ſee them, is oft ſearching to find them out, oft calling himſelf to account, asking,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:92979:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>what have I done?</hi> (Jer. 8.6.) and is for a Soul-ſearching Miniſtry, and for cloſe applying of thoſe Truths, that may help further to humble and break his Heart. He can heartily bleſs the Lord, when he can find his Heart in a tender melting frame. He looks upon a <hi>contrite Heart,</hi> and an <hi>Heart of Fleſh,</hi> as a choice and ſingular Bleſſing, and is never more <hi>at eaſe,</hi> than when his Heart is moſt melting, that he can pour it out before the Lord. And he would not for a World be in his former impenitent ſtate, when he was altogether inſenſible of the evil of Sin.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Godly Sorrow is moſt <hi>inward,</hi> moſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: not only, nor ſo much in appearance before others. A true Mourner for Sin is a <hi>cloſe Mourner.</hi> He is not for putting on a <hi>ſad Countenance,</hi> making a ſhew of more grief and Sorrow, than he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It is true, we are not to underſtand <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.16. as forbidding all <hi>outward expreſſions</hi> of Sorrow. When our Saviour deſcribes the penitent Publican, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. it is thus, that he <hi>would not lift up ſo much as his Eyes unto Heaven, but ſmote upon his Breaſt.</hi> But in that place of the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaks of <hi>private Faſts,</hi> which ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with <hi>privacy.</hi> And forbids an <hi>Hypocritical</hi> diſſimulation, with a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> affectation, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> would appear unto Men what they were not, would put on a ſad Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when they were far from an humble, and mortified Spirit. But Godly Sorrow chiefly <hi>affects ſecrecy.</hi> The <hi>Dovelike Spirit</hi> is for the clefts of the Rock, and <hi>ſecret places</hi> of the Stairs, Cant. 2.14.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Godly Sorrow is <hi>continued,</hi> abiding. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:92979:65"/>have their Conſciences awakened ſometimes, and the Paſſion of grief ſtirred for a fit, it may be; they can weep at the hearing of a Sermon, that toucheth them; but their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is ſoon over.
<note place="margin">Vid. Dyke. <hi>Deceitf. of the Heart.</hi> p. 92.</note> They are (as one ſays) <q>ſometimes <hi>Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;</hi> but no otherwiſe than as Men are <hi>Sea-ſick,</hi> who are well again as ſoon as they come on Shore.</q> Yea, this preſently heals the matter with them, they are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that hereby they have made God amends. And thus the Storm, that was raiſed in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, is laid, and all is quiet again. Sinners have their <hi>ſad moods</hi> ſometimes, but like a <hi>Morning Cloud,</hi> which is ſoon blown over, and as the <hi>early dew,</hi> which ſoon goes away. Whereas a gracious Soul retains an humble broken frame of Heart for Sin, has a <hi>Spirit of Mourning.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>[My Sin is ever before me.]</hi> I cannot look off from it, neither can I think of it, without Sorrow. Even when he may have good hope, through Grace, that God is reconciled to him, yet he cannot for all that be reconciled to himſelf. He is ſtill grieved at the remembrance of his Sins, even when the Lord is <hi>pacified</hi> towards him. We read, Mat. 5.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they that <hi>are mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> As the Participle, there uſed, may denote a <hi>continued</hi> act.</p>
               <p>Yea, one goes further, and layeth it down as not improbable, but that Godly Sorrow (though without any bitter ingredients mixed with it) ſhall be in Heaven. All Tears indeed are wiped from thoſe Bleſſed Eyes. But the Queſtion is of the <hi>Act of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> apprehending the evil of Sin,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:92979:65"/>and of the <hi>will diſliking,</hi> and being diſpleaſed with Sin; whether theſe are not for the <hi>perfection of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and no oppreſſion of it? And whether a clearer ſight, and fuller taſte of God's infinite Goodneſs, which the Saints have in Heaven, be not joyned or attended with a clearer and deeper ſence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the evil of their Sins committed here againſt ſo good a God?
<note place="margin">Vid Symonds. <hi>Caſe and Cure.</hi> p. 239.</note> Which I leave to the diſcuſſion of better Judgments.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Godly Sorrow is a <hi>deep, intenſe</hi> Sorrow: not ſlighty, and ſuperficial. It is called a <hi>great Mourning,</hi> Zach. 12.11. As it is a mourning for Sin, as the greateſt evil. As Sin is the greateſt evil, our greateſt Sorrow ſhould be for Sin. If outward troubles be as a <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> we ſhould be <hi>pricked to the Heart</hi> with a ſence of Sin, Sin ſhould be as a Sword piercing thorow our Souls. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that was never heard to ſay, O miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Man that I am, in regard of the Bonds and Afflictions that did abide him here in the World; yet cryed out, <hi>O wretched Man that I am,</hi> in regard of a Body of Sin. A <hi>Body of Sin</hi> was more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him than all his Sufferings in the Body. And proportionably to the meaſure of Grace any one attains to, as he grows in Grace, ſo his Sorrow for Sin riſeth, his diſplicence againſt Sin encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>But here two or three <hi>Queſtions</hi> are to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Are <hi>Tears</hi> neceſſary to evidence the Truth of our Repentance, and Sorrow for Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We find that the godly mentioned in Scripture, ordinarily were ſuch as could <hi>weep</hi> for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:92979:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sin; yea, ſuch as wept for the Sins of others. As <hi>Ezra</hi> confeſſed <hi>weeping,</hi> Chap. 10.1. <hi>Joſiah</hi> his Heart was tender, and he <hi>wept</hi> before the Lord, 2 King. 22.19. And what Floods of Tears (think we) did <hi>David</hi> pour out for his own Sins, while (as he ſays <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136.) Rivers of Tears ran down his Eyes for the Sins of other Men? And ſee a <hi>weeping Convert,</hi> Luk. 7.37, 38. Who even waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſts Feet with her Tears. So <hi>Peter</hi> after his great Sin, in denying his Maſter, went out, and <hi>wept bitterly,</hi> Mat. 26.37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men are oft called to Humiliation and Sorrow for Sin in Scripture under the term of <hi>weeping.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.12. And <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.9. Be afflicted and mourn, and <hi>weep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath promiſed ſuch a frame to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, that they ſhould <hi>lament after him,</hi> and follow him with Tears. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.9. and 50.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet <hi>Tears</hi> ſometimes may be repreſſed through <hi>exceſs</hi> of inward Sorrow. The Heart is fulleſt of Sorrow ſometimes, when it has no <hi>vent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                  <hi>Leves dolores loquuntur, ingentes ſtupent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Some, how great ſoever their inward Sorrows are, have ſo <hi>dry a conſtitution</hi> as will not afford <hi>Tears.</hi> Thus in regard of that difference there is in their natural conſtitutions, ſighs and groans are more to ſome than plenty of Tears to others. And they may have far more inward Humiliation and Sorrow for Sin, though they cannot ſhed one Tear, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have Tears at will.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Tears</hi> are not pleaſing to God, but as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a <hi>contrite Heart.</hi> God is pleaſed with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:92979:66"/>a contrite Heart, though it cannot command one Tear: when the greateſt abundance of Tears are not acceptable, without a contrite Heart. There are hypocritical Sighs and Tears, as there are hypocritical Confeſſions.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But if we can <hi>weep freely</hi> for outward loſſes or croſſes, that befal us, and yet never weep for Sin, this is a ſhrewd ſign that we are Strangers to Godly Sorrow. Thou that haſt Tears enow, and too many to ſpend about thy Worldly Troubles, ſure, it is not from the dryneſs of thy Brain, or from unaptneſs in thy natural temper and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from the <hi>hardneſs of thy Heart,</hi> if thou never ſheddeſt Tears for thy Sins.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. Whether one truly gracious, may not have <hi>more grief</hi> for ſome great outward Tryal, as the loſs of ſome dear Relation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than he hath for Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. However it is <hi>de facto,</hi> yet <hi>de jure</hi> every one ought to grieve more for Sin, than for Affliction. The <hi>Love of God</hi> requires it. In the Afflictions that befall us the <hi>will of the Lord is done,</hi> (and whatever we <hi>ſuffer,</hi> we ſhould ſay, <hi>The will of the Lord be done:</hi>) but in Sin his will is croſſed, and diſobeyed. There is nothing ſo contrary to God, as Sin. Yea, as the love of God, ſo a <hi>regular ſelf-love</hi> requires it, that we grieve moſt for Sin. There is nothing ſo contrary to our Souls Intereſt, and Happineſs as Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt grief, as ſeated in the <hi>ſenſitive Faculty,</hi> as it is a Paſſion; and as it is ſeated in the <hi>rational Powers,</hi> Underſtanding and Will. So the <hi>Paſſion of Grief</hi> may be greater for ſome ſadly, preſſing, pinching, and ſmarting Tryal
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:92979:67"/>and Affliction, than for Sin, in one that hath true Godly Sorrow. As Grief is common to us with brute Creatures (and as they ſay, the Hart when taken by the Hounds, ſheds tears) the <hi>ſenſitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> and one truly gracious may feel a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of trouble from outward Afflictions, that are nearer to our ſences; and yet the <hi>rational part</hi> has a deeper ſence of Sin, and is more diſquieted for it. As 1. The <hi>practical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and Judgment accounts Sin a greater evil, than all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. A worſe kind of Evil. An Affliction may be grievous, but Sin is odious, and is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed odious, One that hath true Grace, ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be more vile by Sin, than all the Afflictions in the World could make him. 2. There is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>diſlike</hi> of and <hi>diſplicence</hi> againſt Sin in <hi>the Will.</hi> It's poſſible that a Man might dye with leſs pain, than he muſt indure in ſome caſes to preſerve his Life, and yet he would chuſe to ſubmit to great pain, rather than to the moſt eaſy Death. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>travelling Pangs</hi> may be more grievous to ſenſe, than the <hi>Pangs of Death</hi> would be; yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Women would chuſe to endure the former, rather than the latter. Thus a gracious Soul had rather any Affliction ſhould befal him here, than to be left under the Power of Sin. And he is ſo grieved for his Sins paſt, that he could wiſh he had been ſick in his Bed, taken up with pains at that time he was taken up with the pleaſures of Sin. He would ſubmit to any Affliction, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God's Faithfulneſs in afflicting him, may he find this Fruit of it, even the taking away of Sin. He would kiſs the Rod, that whippeth Folly out of his Heart.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:92979:67"/>
               <p n="3">3. One that is truly gracious, is often grieved, that he has been apt to exceed in his grief for and under his Afflictions, and that he hath grieved no more for Sin, that here he falleth ſhort. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth of his immoderate worldly Sorrow, revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth what he hath done, is heartily ſorry that any of his Sighs and Tears ſhould <hi>run waſte,</hi> or have been miſpent, when he hath ſpent too few on his Sins. Thus by an <hi>after-Act</hi> he would <hi>ſubſtract,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from his worldly Sorrow, and make what <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> he can to his Sorrow for Sin. It is a real grief and burthen to his Spirit, that Sin hath not been a greater grief and burthen to him. Which one calleth a <hi>Reflexive Grief.</hi> Beſides a <hi>direct</hi> grief for Sin, there is alſo in a gracious Heart a <hi>reflexive</hi> grief, as it is oft ſad to think, how far ſhort it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in mourning for Sin as it ought. And thus immoderate worldly Sorrow is oft an <hi>occaſion</hi> of the increaſe of godly Sorrow; a ſinful dejection under ſome outward croſs is an occaſion of deeper Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for Sin. A gracious Soul upon a ſerious reflection, and review of it ſelf, is aſhamed of his being ſo caſt down under worldly troubles, and that he is no more humbled under all his Sins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. One that is truly gracious may be more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at ſome great Affliction <hi>for a fit:</hi> but his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin is deeper rooted, and of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. It is true, that commonly (as Mr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaid) <q>When Affliction lieth heavy, Sin lieth light.</q> But the greateſt worldly troubles do not affect the Heart of one that is gracious, <hi>at ſuch a diſtance</hi> as his Sins will do. In a little time he gets over that perturbation of Spirit, raiſed by an Affliction: while his trouble for Sin ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:92979:68"/>He can think of many an Affliction paſt, and bleſs the Lord for his Faithfulneſs in the ſame. As grievous as they were for the preſent, yet he ſees, he could not well have been without them. But he is oft renewing his Sorrow for old Sins. When he may be grown old, yet he oft calls to mind the Iniquities of his Youth with ſhame and grief.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. Whether can one mourn, and <hi>grieve too much</hi> for Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As grief is ſeated in the <hi>rational Faculties,</hi> ſo it is hard for any one to exceed.</p>
               <p>As it implieth a ſenſe, or <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>vileneſs</hi> of Sin. One can hardly think worſe of Sin, than it deſerves; unleſs he conceit <hi>erroneouſly,</hi> that God ſuffers dammage in his very Being, and eſſential Glory and perfection by it: (whereas it is not in the Power of all the Sinners in the World to hurt him in the leaſt, <hi>Job</hi> 35.6, 8. He is over all God <hi>Bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.5.) Or unleſs a Man ſhould think his Sins ſo great, that the Satisfaction, and Merits of Chriſt could not expiate them, or that the free Grace of God could not pardon them.
<note n="*" place="margin">Tanta eſt autem &amp; benignitas Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiae, &amp; Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentia benignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis in Deo, ut nihil ſit quod nolit aut non poſſit relaxare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo. <hi>Fulgent. Epiſt.</hi> 7.</note> But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not <hi>derogating</hi> from the Honour of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, I know not how we can have too bad thoughts of Sin. As it is againſt an infinite Majeſty, againſt the Will of God, againſt his declarative Glory, which ſhineth forth in his moſt wiſe, and righteous Laws, and ſhould be held forth by all his Creatures, eſpecially by Man, a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thus there is more <hi>intrinſick evil,</hi> and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:92979:68"/>in Sin, than our narrow Capacities can fully conceive.</p>
               <p>And as Grief for Sin imports the <hi>Will's diſlike of it,</hi> it is not poſſible that we ſhould be too averſe from Sin, that we ſhould hate Sin too much, or be too much diſpleaſed at it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as Grief is in the <hi>ſenſitive part,</hi> and as it is expreſſed outwardly by Sighs, Groans, and Tears, it may be too much. Though indeed there are very few that erre on this hand. But what the Apoſtle writes to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning the inceſtuous Perſon, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.) that upon his repentance they ſhould comfort him, leſt perhaps he ſhould be <hi>[ſwallowed up of overmuch Sorrow,]</hi> is obſervable here; as it implieth, that even Sorrow for Sin may be <hi>overmuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Paſſion of Grief</hi> is required to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about Sin, not meerly <hi>for it ſelf;</hi> but in order to a further end: As (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) to imbitter Sin to us, to endear Chriſt to us, to make us more willing to part with Sin, and to cloſe with, and accept of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore that Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which <hi>reacheth not</hi> the End, how great ſoever it may ſeem, is not <hi>enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There are other and <hi>higher Duties</hi> that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are alſo called unto. And Duties muſt be ſo managed, that one may not claſh and interfere with, and exclude and juſtle out another. They ought to be ſo carried on, as one may not obſtruct and hinder, but further on and promote another. Now a Life of Faith in Chriſt, and a Life in the Love and joyful Praiſes of God, is that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all Chriſtians ſhould deſire to live, and ſtudy and endeavour by all means to attain unto. And
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:92979:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>our <hi>Sorrow for Sin</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Preparative</hi> to Joy and Delight in the Lord, and ſhould be an Help to cloſe and comfortable walking with God. And for a Chriſtian to be wholly taken up in poring on his Sins, and mourning over them, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exerciſe of Faith, and the drawing out of his Heart to God and Jeſus Chriſt, in love and thankfulneſs, is a very great <hi>practical Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> which muſt needs keep his Soul <hi>low in Grace,</hi> as well as in Comfort.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Sorrow which is <hi>without Hope,</hi> which caſts the Soul into
<note n="*" place="margin">Qualecunque ſit ergo peccatum, a Deo quidem poteſt remitti converſo, ſed ille ſibi remitti non ſinit, qui deſ erando contra ſe indulgentiae oſtium clauſerit. <hi>Fulgent.</hi> Epiſt. 7.</note> Deſpair, is quite <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch,</hi> a dreadful <hi>extreme.</hi> When Souls are taken off from thoſe general Grounds of Hope, <hi>ſcil.</hi> God's abundant Goodneſs and Mercy, the Fulneſs and All-ſufficiency of Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Merits, the Freeneſs of the Offer of Grace to all that will accept it; what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but that ſuch ſhould be overwhelmed and ſwallowed up of Sorrow? As a Man falling into a deep River, periſheth if he let go, and loſe his hold. A deſpairing Sorrow is an <hi>Extreme</hi> oppoſite to godly Sorrow. True Humiliation for Sin, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, is a <hi>giving glory to God;</hi> but Deſpair of ever finding mercy, though we ſhould ſeek to him, this is a great diſhonour to God, a denial of his Goodneſs, Grace and Truth; as it is alſo a great diſhonour unto Chriſt, a denial of his Willingneſs, or of his Ability and All-ſufficiency to ſave all that come unto God by him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When Sorrow is more than <hi>Nature can bear,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:92979:69"/>hazarding Health and Life, or clouding Reaſon, crazing the Brain: This is plain <hi>over-doing.</hi> Thus indeed one ſhould become unfit for the right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this, or any other Duty; yea, become a <hi>ſtumbling-Block</hi> in others way, and prejudice many againſt ſerious Godlineſs, as if it tended to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly or Diſtraction.</p>
               <p>Thus far of Sorrow for Sin. I might alſo have laid down the <hi>Concomitants</hi> of godly Sorrow, by which it may be known: but (becauſe I would not over-burden the Reader, and I have exceeded the bounds of my firſt Intentions,) I ſhall let them paſs.

                  <hi>ſed ex animi demutatione compoſitum eſt.</hi> So Trouble of Mind, without a Change of Mind, is not ſound Repentance. And a real <hi>Change of Mind</hi> there cannot be, but there will alſo be a <hi>Change of Life.</hi> To <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>turn,</hi> are again and again joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, as <hi>Synonyma's,</hi> or one exegetical of the other. Ezek. 18.30. <hi>Repent, and turn your ſelves from all your Tranſgreſſions; ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your Ruin.</hi> Ezek. 14.6. <hi>Repent, and turn your ſelves from your Idols.</hi> Acts 3.19. <hi>Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out.</hi> And compare 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.47. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.37. In the former we read, <hi>[If they ſhall bethink themſelves — and repent];</hi> In the latter thus, <hi>[If they bethink themſelves — and turn].</hi> There is no Repenting without Turning.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Turning</hi> hath two <hi>Terms,</hi> (as all Motions and Mutations have): <hi>A quo, &amp; ad quem.</hi> The Term <hi>from which</hi> a repenting Sinner turneth is Sin. It is from <hi>dead Works,</hi> Heb. 6.1. <hi>From Idols,</hi> Ezek. 14.6. <hi>From his evil Way,</hi> Jonah 3.8. <hi>From all his Tranſgreſſions,</hi> Ezek. 18.30. Sin is a <hi>Turning from God,</hi> Repentance is a <hi>Turning from Sin to God</hi> again. Jer. 8.6. <hi>No Man repented him of his Wickedneſs.</hi>— (How did that appear? thus,) <hi>Every one turned to his Courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battel.</hi> When a Sinner repents, he <hi>makes a ſtand,</hi> asking his Soul, <hi>What have I done?</hi> yea he <hi>faceth about:</hi> wherein he hath done Iniquity, he would do ſo no more.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:92979:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The <hi>Term unto which</hi> a repenting Sinner turneth, is <hi>mediate</hi> or <hi>ultimate.</hi> The <hi>mediate</hi> Term is God's <hi>Teſtimonies;</hi> Pſal. 119.59. <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies.</hi> It is but an half turn to be turned from the practice of Sin, but not to the practice of Holineſs. The <hi>ultimate</hi> Term is God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.4. &amp; 12.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20. That <hi>they ſhould repent, and turn to God.</hi> This in general.</p>
               <p>But hence it is a plain Caſe, that ſuch Sinners remain impenitent,
<note place="margin">Ubi Emendatio nulla, Poenitentia ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſario vana. <hi>Tertul.</hi> de Poenitentia.</note> who ſtill continue as bad as ever, if they do not wax worſe and worſe, more profane and debauch'd. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to that froward Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Deut. 9.24. <hi>You have been rebellious againſt the Lord, from the day that I knew you.</hi> How many are there of whom one may ſay the like? They that knew them many years ſince, knew them to be profane Swearers, Pot-Companions, Scoffers, Haters of them that are good, Enemies to God and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and they are the ſame at this day. Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an extraordinary <hi>Spirit of Diſcerning,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had, one may plainly perceive ſuch to be yet in the <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs,</hi> and <hi>Bond of Iniquity,</hi> (as he ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8.22.) And what will become of ſuch, if they repent not of their Wickedneſs, it is eaſy for any one that looketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Bible (without a <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi>) to ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. You read their Doom, Pſal. 11.6. <hi>

               <p>But becauſe ſome are outwardly reformed, who are not inwardly renewed, or throughly changed, let us come to the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may a Man know that he truly forſakes Sin, and turns from it ſo, as will evidence a ſound Repentance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When it is from a right Principle. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. From a right Fear of God; from a <hi>child-like Fear of offending,</hi> and not a meer <hi>ſlaviſh Fear of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi> Prov. 3.7. <hi>Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</hi> Prov. 16.6. <hi>By the Fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</hi> As we read of <hi>Job,</hi> he was one that <hi>feared God, and eſchewed Evil,</hi> Job 1.1. And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> (Neh. 5.15.) <hi>So did not I, becauſe of the fear of God.</hi> Are we careful to eſchew Sin with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto God, and not only to Men, or to our ſelves? Indeed there is a lawful and good uſe to be made of Divine Threatnings, to reſtrain us from Sin; they are a fit Object to work on our Fear; and we are commanded to <hi>fear him that is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. Luk. 12.5. And commonly this is the firſt <hi>Motive in place,</hi> though the <hi>laſt in dignity</hi> and worth, (as Mr. <hi>A. Burgeſſe</hi> ſays). But more of this, when I come to ſpeak of the Grace of Fear. At preſent note, If we are only reſtrained, and kept in by a <hi>Fear of Puniſhment,</hi> this is but a natural Principle, and ſhews only a ſlaviſh Spirit. To follow Vertue only or chiefly in hope of Reward, is <hi>mercenary;</hi> to flee Vice only or chiefly for fear of Puniſhment, is <hi>ſervile.</hi> But where the true Fear of God ruleth in the Heart, there is a Fear of diſpleaſing and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:92979:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>offending God, and not only of ſuffering.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we forſake Sin out of <hi>Love to God.</hi> Pſal. 97.10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate Evil.</hi> So this is right, when our Love to God will not ſuffer us to walk contrary to him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.4. <hi>Oh do not this abominable thing that I hate.</hi> When this is a prevailing Argument to keep us from Sin, that God hates it, this would ſhew that we love God. When we would not diſpleaſe him, would not grieve his Spirit, and would not diſhonour God, (as we would be aſhamed to wrong and abuſe our <hi>beſt Friend</hi>) and would not be ſo unlike to God as Sin makes us, and would not follow ſuch a Courſe, as would <hi>ſeparate</hi> betwixt us and our God, and would <hi>hinder</hi> our Communion with God; theſe things would ſhew a loving, child-like diſpoſition towards God, and that we <hi>forſake</hi> Sin from a gracious <hi>Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When we forſake Sin from an <hi>hatred</hi> of it. When Sin is not onely barely left, but loathed; when we turn from it, having our Hearts turned againſt it. Pſal. 101.3. <hi>I hate the Work of them that turn aſide;</hi> (then it follows) <hi>it ſhall not cleave to me.</hi> Prov. 8.13. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is to hate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> not only to depart from Evil, but to hate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. There is a Contrariety and Oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Grace and Sin. Where true Grace is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is not only a declining of Evil from the force of Education, or Example, or as being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Rewards promiſed, or Puniſhments that are threatned; but there is an Averſneſs to Sin it ſelf, from a contrary Principle within, a Deteſtation of it, an Antipathy againſt it. It is part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a wicked Man, Pſal. 36.4. that <hi>he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth not evil.</hi> And a bare Abſtinence from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:92979:72"/>ward Act of Sin is not enough, without an <hi>abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of it. While a Man retains a <hi>ſecret love,</hi> and liking of Sin (in Gods account) he <hi>lives in Sin,</hi> though he refrains from the groſs outward Act.
<note n="†" place="margin">Quid quod vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumas facti origo eſt? — Vaniſſimum eſt dicere, volui, nec ramen feci. — Sicut malum non perſicis, nec concupiſcere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bueras. <hi>Tertul. de Paenit.</hi>
                  </note> Though one be not drunk with the Drunkards, though one doth not ſwear with the Swearers, nor mock and taunt with the Scoffers; yet it is bad enough, to <hi>have pleaſure in them</hi> that are ſuch, (Rom. 1.32.) As it is a ſign that we do not truly hate Sin, if we are not willing to forſake it; So on the other hand, we do not rightly forſake Sin, if we do not hate it.</p>
               <p>There are ſome whoſe Sins leave and forſake them, rather than they leave and forſake their Sins. Some there are, who do not put away their Sins, but are forced to part with them. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was forced to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. As <hi>Phaltiel</hi> parted with <hi>Michal,</hi> when he could keep her no longer; but was ſad at parting, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>But there is a great difference betwixt a Mans parting with what he loveth, and his caſting away what is loathſome to him. It is very unpleaſing, and grievous to him, to part with what he loveth. And this ſhews a Man's love to Sin, when he is ſad to think of parting with it; when it is grievous to him, to think of parting with his vain Companions, ſinful Pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When it is very unpleaſing to him, to hear his Sins ſpoken againſt, reproved, and threatned. When it is irkſome to him, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or Governours keep him in, will not ſuffer him to take his Swing; or when he is under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:92979:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>by Poverty, Sickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what a Man loaths, and abhors, he is moſt willing to put away. Such things as one hath an <hi>Antipathy</hi> againſt, he is ready to flee from, or is not at eaſe, till they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of his ſight. So a Man that loaths Sin, how earneſtly does he deſire to be rid of it? how glad would he be, to have Sin removed quite out of his ſight? He could not be ſatisfied only with a removal of the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin, to be left under the <hi>Power</hi> of Sin. The preſence, and prevalency of Sin, greatly afflict him. The very preſence of Sin is a ſad annoyance, and diſturbance to a gracious Spirit. A Man cannot delight in the Company of thoſe he hates. So if we hate Sin, we are ſick of it, weary of it, we would have no more to do with it. And this is a right turning from Sin, when it is caſt off, and abandoned with hatred, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation. So</p>
               <p n="4">4. When it is forſaken from a firm, and <hi>fixed reſolution</hi> in the Soul againſt it. Many have a <hi>wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Will</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſays) but no <hi>ſettled purpoſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Caſes of Conſc.</hi> l. 1. c. 5. §. 4. p. 16. in Vol. 2.</note> But now where the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love of God,</hi> and <hi>hatred of Sin</hi> prevails in the Heart, there will be a rooted, <hi>ſettled reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> againſt Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a good ſign, that a Man truly forſakes Sin, when he ſetteth againſt his <hi>inward corruptions,</hi> and feareth to Sin <hi>in ſecret.</hi> Some are tender of their credit, while they have no <hi>tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> as they are not afraid of being guilty of thoſe Sins <hi>in ſecret,</hi> which they would be aſhamed, that others ſhould know. Cloſe Chapmen, cunning Gameſters, that love to <hi>play under-Board.</hi> Some
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:92979:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>are for their private Walks, and ſo ſly, that others ſhall have much a doe to trace them. Their way is like the <hi>way of a Serpent on the Rock,</hi> or of <hi>a Ship in the Sea.</hi> But let ſuch know, <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are open upon all the ways of the Sons of Men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings,</hi> Jer. 32.19. Prov. 5.21. There is no blind-folding of the Eye of God's Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And as he ſees the moſt ſecret Sins; ſo when at laſt he ſhall <hi>turn the way of the wicked upſide down,</hi> he will lay all open to the view of the whole World. There is <hi>nothing ſecret,</hi> which <hi>ſhall not be revealed: nothing hid, which ſhall not be made known.</hi> Your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sins will one day find you out, and will come out at laſt.</p>
               <p>But he that truly forſakes Sin, dares not allow of Sin in ſecret. Yea, he is for mortifying his moſt <hi>inward</hi> corruptions. He would not that <hi>any way of Wickedneſs</hi> ſhould be found <hi>in him,</hi> Pſal. 139.24. It is not enough to put Iniquity out of our hands, while we <hi>regard Iniquity</hi> in our Hearts. What is it, to be like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that were only for <hi>making clean the outſide of the Cup, and Platter?</hi> We muſt not only cleanſe our Hands, but ſee to the <hi>purifying of our Hearts,</hi> Jam. 4.8. You would think ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of deriſion, that ſweep before their Doors, while they care not how ſluttiſh the Houſe is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. A Wound may have its courſe of bleeding out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly quite ſtopt, and yet be deadly, if it bleeds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Oh, how many, whoſe Spiritual Wounds <hi>bleed inwardly!</hi> Many whoſe Conſciences tell them, the Act of Uncleanneſs would be too groſs, that yet allow themſelves in ſpeculative Wickedneſs. And what ſtreams of unclean thoughts, of proud
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:92979:73"/>thoughts, of envious and malicious thoughts? What ſtreams of carnal, covetous thoughts are continually iſſuing from their Hearts without any check?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a good ſign indeed, that a Man truly forſakes Sin, when he <hi>eſpecially</hi> ſetteth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>ſpecial ſin.</hi> Pſal. 18.23. <hi>I was upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: and I kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi> When a Man is for getting down and keeping down thoſe Sins, to which he is moſt inclined, this ſhews he is no longer in league with Sin.</p>
               <p>If we are not great Strangers to our own Souls, we ſhall find our ſelves more prone to ſome one Sin, than to other. One to Pride, another to Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, another to ſenſual Pleaſure, another to Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though where there is true Grace, no known Sin is ſuffered to <hi>reign,</hi> is fully and quietly obeyed, yet ſome Sin may <hi>tyrannize.</hi> A <hi>Maſter-Sin</hi> is not always a <hi>reigning Sin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Cathol. Theol. <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 108.</note> Though a Learned, and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Divine</hi> queſtioneth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome <hi>particular Sin</hi> in a Child of God may not be ſtronger, than the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular gracious habit that is oppoſite unto it. And as he ſays, <q>That they <hi>err,</hi> who tell us that all Sin is <hi>equally</hi> mortified in the <hi>habit,</hi> common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence fully proveth.</q> Yet ſuch Sin is ſo far from having <hi>abſolute command</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> over one truly gracious, that the more he finds its ſtirring and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency, ordinarily the more he bends the ſtrength of his Prayers and Reſolutions againſt that Sin. That Sin is wont to coſt him moſt Sighs, and Tears. And though he be ſorely <hi>foiled</hi> by it ſometimes; yet he is ſtill for renewing his <hi>Conflict</hi> with it. He does
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:92979:74"/>not yeild up himſelf unto it. It is <hi>the evil he would not:</hi> it is a thing <hi>which he hates,</hi> Rom. 7.15, 19. And that Sin, which is more the matter of our Grief and Sorrow, than of our Delight; which is <hi>more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> than <hi>loved;</hi> which we are not for keeping, but would gladly part with, and would account it a ſpecial Mercy, a deliverance indeed, to be freed from; that Sin is not <hi>reigning,</hi> however for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it may <hi>tyrannize,</hi> and ſadly oppreſs the Soul.</p>
               <p>One thing more I muſt add here, That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Sinners are for <hi>changing.</hi> They ſometimes <hi>fall out</hi> with one Luſt they had been in league with, to <hi>fall in</hi> with another, with which now they are more pleaſed. A Sinner that was formerly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> and cared not what he ſpent about his ſenſual pleaſures, may now be more taken with worldly Riches: <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> may have got hold on him, whereupon he may be ſo changed in his courſe, as if his Voluptuouſneſs was mortified. One that hath been profane, may leave his profane courſes, and turn into a way of <hi>ſtudied Hypocriſy,</hi> to get a Name, and make a Show in the World. When (Alas!) this is but a fairer, and <hi>ſmoother way</hi> to Hell. To turn from one Sin to another, is not to forſake Sin. This is but like the <hi>turning of a Door upon its Hinges (movetur, ſed non promovetur:)</hi> or like the <hi>Sluggards turning</hi> from ſide to ſide <hi>on his Bed.</hi> It is nothing to decline and put away ſome Sins, becauſe they ſtand in the way of ſome other Luſt, to which a Man is more addicted. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is ſomething, for a Man to ſet againſt that Sin, which yet of all his Sins hath moſt Power, and the greateſt Intereſt; when a Man cannot reſt,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:92979:74"/>till he has alſo got this Sin ſubdued, it ſhews there is <hi>no Sin reſerved,</hi> though he have Sin ſtill <hi>remaining</hi> in him, while here. So</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then a Man-truly forſakes Sin, when he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt <hi>all known Sin.</hi> This evidenceth ones <hi>oppoſition</hi> to be againſt Sin, <hi>as Sin.</hi> And that Man, who would not allow himſelf in any <hi>cloſe way</hi> of Wickedneſs, would not harbour any ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, who would not ſpare any <hi>darling-Sin,</hi> who is engaged, and heartily ſtrives againſt his <hi>Maſter-Sin;</hi> ſurely, that Man will as well reſolve and ſtrive againſt any other known Sin. When the <hi>main ſtrength</hi> of Sin is broken, then there's hope of its falling more and more. And indeed if Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be ſound, there is not a <hi>partial,</hi> but a <hi>thorow-reformation.</hi> Jer. 7.5. <hi>If ye throughly amend your ways, and your doings</hi> — Ezek. 18.28. Becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth and <hi>turneth away from all his Tranſgreſſions,</hi> he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But who can ſay, I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> Prov. 20.9. Does not the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſay (chap. 3.2.) <hi>In many things we offend all?</hi> And will you not grant, that the beſt upon Earth have <hi>Sins of daily incurſion?</hi> How then do they turn away <hi>from all</hi> their Tranſgreſſions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There are no Sins <hi>ſo ſmall,</hi> but the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate,</hi> licentious, <hi>reſolved</hi> practice of them, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove a Man in a graceleſs and damnable Eſtate. Thus a Man may be <hi>condemned</hi> even for <hi>idle words,</hi> Mat. 12.36, 37. So a Man may go to Hell <hi>in earneſt</hi> for <hi>fooliſh jeſting,</hi> and the like. And if any Man <hi>ſeem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, this Man's Religion is vain,</hi> Jam. 1.26. <hi>Small Crevices,</hi> not lookt unto, may let in Water enough
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:92979:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>to ſink the Ship. A little <hi>prick at the Heart</hi> is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A <hi>little Poiſon,</hi> without uſing means againſt it, may give a Man enough, may be his <hi>Bane.</hi> Not only groſs Sins, but ſuch as many count <hi>venial</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being indulged, and allowed of, may ſink Souls into Hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One that hath true Grace makes not ſo light of thoſe Sins of <hi>daily incurſion,</hi> as the Unregenerate are wont to do. He is humbled, and grieveth for them, condemneth himſelf for them, and according to the degree and meaſure of Grace he hath attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, he is watching and ſtriving againſt them. In ſome meaſure he is <hi>turned from</hi> them both in <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> too. <hi>Vain thoughts</hi> abound not ſo much in him, his <hi>idle words</hi> ariſe not to ſuch a reckoning, as before, while he was inſenſible of the evil of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a great difference betwixt <hi>groſs wilful Sins,</hi> and <hi>Sins of Infirmity.</hi> Wilful, groſs Sins ordinarily committed, ſhew the utter abſence of Grace. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1. <hi>The Tranſgreſſion of the Wicked ſaith within my Heart, that there is no fear of God before his Eyes.</hi> Such as live in <hi>preſumptuous Sins,</hi> are plainly <hi>under the Dominion of Sin:</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>under the Dominion of Sin</hi> cannot be <hi>upright.</hi> So much we may gather from. Pſal. 19.13. <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous Sins, let them not have Dominion over me: then ſhall I be upright.</hi> Such are <hi>Conſcience-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Sins.</hi> What ſhould one think of ſuch as live in groſs known Sins; but that they are <hi>dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> and <hi>Sins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But continued Sins of <hi>Infirmity</hi> will not prove the <hi>utter abſence</hi> of Grace, but only <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi> in Grace. A Man may be ſincere, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:92979:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>have a true <hi>love to Holineſs,</hi> and a real <hi>hatred of Sin,</hi> as Sin, that ſhall never be abſolutely freed from Sins <hi>of Infirmity</hi> while he lives; yet ſuch a one bears them as his <hi>Burthen,</hi> he complains of them, as worſe than any <hi>natural Infirmities,</hi> he deſires to be rid of them more and more. And thus <hi>in voto &amp; conatu,</hi> in deſire and indeavour he forſakes all known Sin, breathing and preſſing after perfect Holineſs, though here he cannot attain to it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But may not one that hath true Grace yet fall into groſs Sin? as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is <hi>poſſible</hi> (we muſt confeſs) and more than poſſible: but (I hope) not <hi>common.</hi> Much leſs is it the <hi>common practiſe</hi> of ſuch to commit groſs Sins. If it was, what difference would there he betwixt the <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified.</hi> Though <hi>Peter fell</hi> fouly, yet he <hi>aroſe quickly,</hi> as we read, he went out, and <hi>wept bitterly.</hi> And it is probable, <hi>David</hi> had ſome remorſe for his Sin before <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent to him, (though his Repentance was not anſwerable to the greatneſs of his Offence) but we no more find him guilty that way. It was a <hi>warning</hi> to him. Though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine, how oft a Godly Man may fall into groſs Sin; Yet certainly, there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Godly Mans <hi>falls</hi> and the wicked Mans <hi>walk.</hi> Indeed ſuch groſs Sins being <hi>evidently known</hi> to be Sins, and great and grievous Sins, more hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their <hi>own nature,</hi> uſe terribly to <hi>allarm</hi> the Conſcience, when committed; that without an <hi>hatred</hi> of, and <hi>fixed reſolution</hi> againſt them, a Man can have no evidence of the truth of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:92979:76"/>his Repentance. And a fixed Reſolution againſt ſuch Sins will not ſtand with the frequent and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary practice and commiſſion of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is an hopeful Sign that a Man truly forſakes his Sins, when he is for <hi>undoing</hi> what he hath <hi>done</hi> amiſs (ſo far as in him lieth): That is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Heartily wiſhing he had never done ſo, wiſhing he had rather been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering under the Hand of God at ſuch and ſuch a time,
<note place="margin">Poenitentia eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexio intellectus ad improbandum male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factum; affectio no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendi feciſſe. <hi>Scalig. Subt.</hi> p. 1010.</note> when he was ſinning againſt God; wiſhing he had rather begged his Bread, than got an Eſtate by Injuſtice, Fraud, Theft; wiſhing he had been lower in the World, ſo that his Corruptions might be brought down. As one ſays, He that doth not <hi>wiſh</hi> he had never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittted ſuch Sins, hath a will to commit them ſtill, ſuppoſing the like Opportunities and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being ready to make Satisfaction and Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in ſuch Caſes, and ſo far as he is able. Indeed as Sin is againſt God, no meer Man could ever <hi>make Satisfaction,</hi> but that Work is proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar unto Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man. Yet as we may have wronged others, in many Caſes we may and ought to make them Satisfaction; and thus we ſhould after a ſort <hi>undo</hi> what we have <hi>done amiſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we have wronged the Souls of others by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or encouraging them to Sin, we are under a greater <hi>Obligation</hi> to do what in us lyeth to draw them to Repentance, and turn them from Sin, that they be not undone by us and it. We muſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:92979:76"/>to do as much good this way, as ever former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have done hurt. The <hi>penitent Thief</hi> indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring his Companion in Sin and Suffering to Repentance, as we ſee, Luke 23.40, 41, <hi>Doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame Condemnation? And we indeed juſtly, for we receive the due Reward of our Deeds,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If we have wronged others in their <hi>good Names,</hi> by unjuſt Cenſures, falſe Reports, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt willingly take ſhame for it, and be ready to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> what we have unjuſtly ſaid againſt them.</p>
               <p>If we have wronged others in their worldly Goods and Eſtates, we muſt be for repairing the Damage they have ſuffered by us, if it may be by <hi>Reſtitution;</hi> or if (we cannot make <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of the ſame thing unjuſtly taken or kept from them, then) by <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> with ſomething of as great worth and uſe to them, as the thing it ſelf would have been. This is ſo <hi>plain a Duty,</hi> that none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; how few ſoever there are that will practiſe it. But true Repentance will put upon the practice of it. See a notable Inſtance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.1. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.14, 15. <hi>If he turn from his Sin,</hi>

It is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that any ſhould ſteal, and take away any thing unjuſtly from their Neighbour, with an intent to ſerve God with what is not their own.</p>
               <p>And the like Courſe is to be taken, when a Man knoweth not whom or how many he hath wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Break off thy Sins by Righteouſneſs, and thine Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the poor.</hi> Such as have been ſcraping Eſtates together by covetous practices, by oppreſſing, over-reaching and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding others; ſuch as have made it their Trade to injure as many as they could, who have had dealing with them; ſuch as can never find out all that have ſuffered by them: as they would manifeſt their Repentance to be ſerious, muſt be ready <hi>to do good to all as they have opportunity,</hi> and muſt ſo much the more abound in <hi>Acts of Charity,</hi> as before they have abounded in the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what if a Man hath been ſo injurious to others, that his whole Eſtate will not make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction?</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:92979:77"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a ſad Caſe indeed! But he ought to go as far as he can in ſatisfying thoſe whom he hath wronged; and what he cannot do at preſent, he muſt <hi>reſolve,</hi> and be willing to promiſe to make full ſatisfaction when God makes him able, (unleſs the injured and ſuffering Party freely releaſe and diſcharge him). Yea, when he cannot do it of himſelf, he ſhould improve his Intereſt in Friends, if they would be perſwaded to help him out. And this is certain, that true <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi> cannot be <hi>bought too dear,</hi> though all a Man hath in the World goes for it. In this Caſe a Man ſhould be for undoing his Sin, (ſo far as he can) although it would be his undoing in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a Man by extream Poverty is quite diſabled to make Satisfaction for the Wrongs he hath done. Though the Act thus becoming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible be not neceſſary; yet the Will, I ſay, a Will to ſatisfy if he was able, or when he ſhalll be able, is neceſſary, without which there is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his true Repentance of the Sin, or that the Sin is pardoned. There muſt be a ſerious and hearty willingneſs to do it, if a man be in a capacity to do it; and this ought to afflict him more than ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Poverty, that he cannot do it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. One that is indeed turned from Sin, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is very careful to avoid <hi>Occaſions of Sin,</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fears to run upon Temptations. As the burnt Child dreads the Fire.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Such an one having his Heart turned againſt Sin, ordinarily ſhunneth and abſtaineth from the very <hi>appearance of Evil;</hi> what looketh like Sin he is wont to ſtartle at; he would keep as far from Sin as may be; he fears to come near it.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:92979:78"/>
               <p n="8">8. Such a one would <hi>turn others</hi> from <hi>Sin</hi> too. He would not, that others ſhould walk on in Sin, if he can hinder it. He is oppoſing Sin in others; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe who are near and dear to him, and in whom he hath moſt Intereſt. And ſuch as formerly he was drawing to Sin, he will look on himſelf as doubly engaged, to do what he can to help them out of the Snare. Thus ſuch as have been notorious in Sin and Wickedneſs, after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion are ordinarily ſeen to be moſt zealous againſt it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. One that rightly turneth from Sin, would never <hi>return</hi> to it more. He will ſay as <hi>Ephraim, What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes a Sinner and his Luſt ſeem to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out, but they are ſoon piec'd again. He may be <hi>angry with Sin</hi> for a fit, but does not <hi>hate</hi> and forſake it. Now when the unclean Spirit returns, after he ſeem'd to be caſt out, he uſeth to get ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er poſſeſſion, that the <hi>laſt Eſtate of that Man is worſe than the firſt,</hi> Luk. 11.24, 25, 26. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh after the like manner of ſuch as had <hi>eſcaped the Pollutions of the World,</hi> but were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again <hi>intangled and overcome, as the Dog returns to his Vomit, The latter End,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is worſe with them than the beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>But a right forſaking of Sin is ſet forth by ſuch Expreſſions, as <hi>plucking out the right Eye, cutting off the right Hand,</hi> Mat. 5.29, 30. (and there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring any of theſe Members, when ſeparated from the Body) And by <hi>crucifying the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.24. And <hi>mortifying the earthly Members,</hi> Col. 3.5. In true Repentance Sin receives its <hi>Death's Wound.</hi> Though it ſtir and ſtruggle ſtill, its <hi>Head is broken;</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:92979:78"/>yea, it is wounded at the Heart, ſo wounded that it can never recover its full Power and Dominion. Now it is <hi>dying,</hi> though but a <hi>lingring Death.</hi> How many that do but ſeemingly oppoſe, that deſire not, reſolve not on the Death of Sin? They are but like <hi>Fencers,</hi> they do not fight in good earneſt: As <hi>Fencers</hi> ſometimes ſeem to be in a deadly Feud, while ſecretly they are in League, and very good Friends.</p>
               <p>Some reform <hi>for a fit,</hi> but ſoon face about, and as <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife, <hi>look back upon Sodom.</hi> Some part with their Sins, as <hi>Mariners</hi> throw their Goods o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-board in a Storm, who are ready to gather them up again when the Storm is over; ſo they will <hi>ſeek their Luſts again.</hi> Such a temporary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is little worth. This is not the Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance never to be repented of. There is <hi>Joy in Heaven</hi> over a Sinner that truly repents and turns from Sin; but when a Sinner is for returning to his <hi>old Sins</hi> again, none but the Devils and wicked Men can be pleaſed with this fight.</p>
               <p>True it is, a godly Man oft ſinneth againſt his <hi>Reſolution,</hi> but he ſinneth not with <hi>Reſolution,</hi> as the ungodly do. His Will and Reſolution is ſtill againſt Sin, though Corruption remaining in him, raiſed by the Violence of Temptation, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and floweth <hi>over the Bank</hi> of his ſet Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p n="10">(10.) He that truly forſakes Sin, turneth ſo from Sin, that withal he <hi>turneth unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I come to the Term unto which the repenting Sinner turneth.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:92979:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>For one to reſt here, that he has left ſuch and ſuch Sins, unto which he was addicted, is, <hi>in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu impingere,</hi> to ſuffer Shipwrack in the Haven. And how ſad is that! An half-turn would prove Men but almoſt Chriſtians. And they that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chriſtians, are but almoſt ſaved. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which <hi>Paul</hi> preached was Repentance, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>unto God,</hi> Acts 20.21. As Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance has <hi>one Eye on Sin,</hi> to mourn for it, and to ſhun and avoid it; ſo it hath <hi>another Eye towards God,</hi> to turn to him, and follow him. Jer. 4.1. <hi>If thou wilt return, O Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, return unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. How may a Man know that he turneth unto God aright?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When the <hi>Heart is turned unto God,</hi> that is right. Whatever a Man doth in Religion <hi>without the Heart,</hi> is to no purpoſe, as not done at all. Prayer <hi>without the Heart</hi> is vain Babling; and Service preſented to God <hi>without the Heart,</hi> is but a vain Oblation. If we would ſeek the Lord ſo as to find him, we muſt <hi>ſearch for him with all our Hearts.</hi> That is but a feigned Turning to God, which is without the Heart. Jer. 3.10. <hi>Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole Heart, but feignedly, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How can we ſay that we are turned to God, if <hi>our Hearts are not with him?</hi> if our Hearts incline more another way? We cannot deny but natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are ſet upon Sin and the World, and averſe from God, (ſo far are Mans Hearts corrupted by the Fall). But are our Hearts now changed? Are they turned, and now chiefly ſet upon God? Is God the Center, towards whom our Hearts now moſt incline? Are they ſet upon him as the chiefeſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:92979:79"/>Good? If not, we have not as yet turned to him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a Man is turned to God, he will <hi>ſhake off</hi> his ſinful Companions, and <hi>joyn himſelf</hi> to ſuch as fear God, yea his Heart will cleave to ſuch. He can no longer delight in the Company of thoſe, who make it their work and paſtime, both to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and would draw him to do the like. But his Delight is in the Saints, ſuch as bear God's Image. As the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee.</hi> But, <hi>Depart from me, ye Evil-Doers; for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. One that is turned to God will be for turning others to him. If we are turned to God, it will grieve us to ſee others, and eſpecially to ſee any of ours, ſtrangers to him, and at a great diſtance from him, walking contrary to him. If we are brought home to God, we ſhall be inclined to pity and pray for poor Sinners, that ſtill ly out from God, that ſeek not after him. Oh, (think we) what Enemies theſe are to themſelves! Alas, how do they forſake their own Mercy, to follow lying Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities! We ſhall deſire (whatever the Succeſs be) that we may not omit our Duty; but may tell them of the evil of their ways, as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and endeavour to reclaim them. The Righteous would be turning others to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. One that is turned to God, is for <hi>walking with him.</hi> Now he is for walking in God's ways.</p>
               <p>Repentance ſoftneth the Heart, and ſo prepares it to receive an <hi>Impreſſion</hi> from God's Word, which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:92979:80"/>the ſtony, hard, and impenitent Heart reſiſteth. And where Sin, as Sin, is grievous, there God's Commands are not grievous, but ſuch a Soul will deſire and delight to obey them. A Soul that is turned to God, will fear to walk contrary to him, in any way of Diſobedience. Such a one would keep cloſe to God. His Care, Study and Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is, to <hi>walk in all the Commandments of the Lord, blameleſs.</hi> Thus ſound Repentance will produce ſincere Obedience. And this is <hi>bringing forth Fruits,</hi> and <hi>doing Works meet for Repentance,</hi> (Mat. 3.8. Acts 26.20.) to obey God's Commands ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and impartially. A meer external Obedience is not enough, but we muſt obey from the Heart. A partial Obedience is not enough, but we muſt have a <hi>Reſpect unto all God's Commands,</hi> not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to neglect or tranſgreſs any one Precept, either of the firſt or ſecond Table. As we would prove that we are indeed turned to God, we muſt make it our Care to walk uprightly before him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If indeed we are turned to God, we would be getting ſtill nearer and nearer to him. As the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My Soul followeth hard after thee.</hi> We ſhall <hi>follow on to know the Lord,</hi> and to enjoy more of him. We ſhall be for more conformity to God, and for more communion with him. One that is turned to God, is not for ſtanding at a ſtay in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. He would be making progreſs in Heaven's way, in the way of Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. One that is turned to God, now <hi>cleaveth</hi> to him <hi>with purpoſe of Heart.</hi> His reſolution is (by the help of Divine Grace) to <hi>follow the Lord fully.</hi> So if we are turned to God, we would no more
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:92979:80"/>turn away from him. We have enough of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God: we would never more <hi>wickedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from</hi> him. The remembrance of our former courſe will oft make our Hearts ſad. Have we not <hi>found it an evil thing, and bitter,</hi> that formerly we <hi>forſook the Lord,</hi> that his fear was not in us? So our Hearts will ſmite us now, when we have been ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a little aſide. It will grieve us, that we do not at all times keep ſo cloſe to God, as we ought. And we ſhall dread the thoughts of <hi>departing from God,</hi> more than of parting with all we have in the World. As the Church, Pſal. 44.17, 18. <hi>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, our Heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way.</hi> So we ſhall deſire, whatever befalleth us in the World for his ſake, that we may never be falſe to him, may never more forſake him. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy</hi> is a dreadful ſign of Impenitency.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe beſt are not freed from the in-being, and <hi>in-dwelling</hi> of Sin here, 1 Joh. 1.8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> Yet all that are in a <hi>ſtate of Grace,</hi> are freed from the <hi>Dominion of Sin.</hi> And where Sin is not <hi>mortified,</hi> it is <hi>mortal.</hi> That it greatly concerns every one ſtrictly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether Sin be ſubdued, or yet <hi>reigning</hi> in him?</p>
            <p>Alas! How many account their Sins no more than <hi>Infirmities,</hi> when indeed they are <hi>reigning.</hi> A moſt dangerous deceit! As there are many (on the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:92979:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>other hand) truly gracious, who feeling the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Corruption, are thence ready to conclude, or at leaſt fear and ſuſpect, they are ſtill under the <hi>Dominion of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you briefly, how you may know whether Sin hath Dominion over you? Or whether (by Grace) you are freed from Sins Dominion?</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Dominion of Sin</hi> here, I underſtand, not the <hi>actual Prevalence</hi> of ſome Sin for a fit, but the <hi>habitual Power of Sin,</hi> whereby a Man is in a ſtate of <hi>Subjection to Sin.</hi> That the Queſtion amounts to thus much, Whether a Principle of Grace, or Corruption, be <hi>chief Ruler</hi> and Commander in you?</p>
            <p>I premiſe theſe two or three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Man cannot poſſibly be at the ſame time, both under the Dominion of Sin, and alſo under the Rule and Government of Grace. A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Servant of <hi>Sin,</hi> and a Servant of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> both together. None can ſerve two Maſters ſo contrary. It is a clear, and ſufficient proof, we are not in a <hi>ſtate of Grace,</hi> if we be <hi>under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are all <hi>naturally</hi> under the dominion of Sin. This all, that underſtand, and acknowledg Mans Fall, and Original Sin, muſt acknowledg. And the Scripture abounds in the proof of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore unleſs we have been <hi>changed</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing ſanctifying Grace, we are ſtill under the power and dominion of Sin. Theſe things are plain, and undeniable.</p>
            <p>Now Firſt, I ſhall diſcover certain <hi>falſe ſigns,</hi> whereupon many, without ground, conclude they are not under the dominion of Sin.</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:92979:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) You may not be ſenſible of the commanding, domineering Power of Sin, and yet be really under the dominion of Sin. As (on the other hand) a Man may feel the workings and ſtirrings of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, who is not under the full Power and Dominion of it. Sin ruleth <hi>by way of enticing,</hi> not by Force and <hi>Violence.</hi> Its chief Seat and Throne is in the Will; and the leſs Reluctancy in the Will againſt Sin, the greater is its Power and Dominion. And Inſenſibleneſs of Sin is a great ſign of its Strength and Prevalence. A ſick Man's caſe is many times moſt ſad, when he has no ſenſe of his Sickneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) You may not be <hi>under Terrors</hi> of Conſcience for Sin, and yet may be under the Dominion of Sin. While the <hi>ſtrong Man keeps his Palace,</hi> all is <hi>in Peace.</hi> An <hi>evil</hi> Conſcience may be a <hi>quiet</hi> Conſcience, may be lull'd aſleep for a time.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) You may be <hi>under the arreſt</hi> of your own Conſciences. Conſcience may ſhake, and terrifie you, and thus you may be brought to a <hi>kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe</hi> for Sin, and yet not freed from the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin. Sinner, wouldeſt thou fain put off Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? doſt thou indeavour to do all thou canſt to ſtop its Mouth, to ſtill its Clamours? Art thou far from joyning and taking part with Conſcience againſt thy Luſts? Then it is plain, thou art joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thy Luſts. And whatever trouble thou haſt for ſins committed, if it does not <hi>weaken</hi> the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and <hi>Habit of Sin</hi> in thee; if it be not joyned with a ſerious purpoſe and reſolution againſt Sin; if thou art as ready to commit the ſame Sin again, when a Temptation and Opportunity is offered; thy Repentance is little better than a Mock-repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:92979:82"/>
            <p n="4">(4.) Thou mayeſt have a <hi>kind of Conflict</hi> within thy ſelf againſt Sin, and yet be under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin. For, 1. Sometimes one <hi>Luſt makes head</hi> againſt another. Though all Sins agree in their <hi>general Nature,</hi> as contrary to the holy Law of God: yet ſome Sins diſagree in reſpect of their <hi>particular Objects</hi> and Intereſts. So Pride may ſet againſt ſuch Sins as would bring a Man to ſhame and diſgrace. So a Sinner's Covetouſneſs may croſs a coſtly expenſive Luſt, which otherwiſe he has a mind on. 2. Or the Conflict in a Sinner is thus, his <hi>Will</hi> is to ſerve and ſatisfy ſuch a Luſt, but his <hi>Conſcience</hi> is againſt it. Thus a Sinner hath many ſad checks of Conſcience ſore againſt his Will. The Conſcience of many a natural Man does not only oft <hi>accuſe and condemn</hi> him for Sins committed; but alſo ſometimes does <hi>check, menace,</hi> and <hi>terrify</hi> him, when he is about the commiſſion of Sin: while yet the <hi>Will</hi> is predominantly ſet upon Sin. As there may be Inſurrections, great Stirs and Buſles in a Kingdom againſt its Government, and yet the Government not be caſt off, but may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail and ſuppreſs thoſe Inſurrections. So Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſtirring in a Sinner ſometimes, it riſeth up againſt ſuch or ſuch a Luſt; but for all that there is a ſtronger Party within, a corrupt Will, a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Appetite and Affections, that adhere to it ſtill, and keep it in the Throne.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) A Child of God may fall into the ſame Sin, <hi>(materially)</hi> and yet that be but a Sin of <hi>Infirmity</hi> in him, which may be a <hi>reigning</hi> Sin in thee. Though thou mayeſt ſometimes ſee thoſe that are better than thy ſelf overtaken with Paſſion; or ſee them ſometimes immoderate, ſpending too
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:92979:83"/>much precious time in Sports and Recreations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet, Sinner, know there is a difference betwixt their <hi>falling into</hi> a Sin, and thy living and <hi>lying ſtill</hi> in it. There is a difference betwixt their being ſometimes <hi>foiled</hi> by it, and thy <hi>yielding up</hi> thy ſelf fully to it. There is a difference betwixt their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repenting of it, and breaking off a Courſe of Sin, and thy allowing and full liking of it, and holding on thy Courſe.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Thou mayeſt be free from all <hi>groſs Sins,</hi> and yet be under the Dominion of Sin. Though Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſometimes diſtinguiſh betwixt a <hi>partial</hi> and a <hi>total Dominion</hi> of Sin, and ſay further, that a <hi>partial Dominion</hi> of Sin may ſtand with a <hi>State of Grace,</hi> but not a <hi>total:</hi> yet here you muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, as if by <hi>partial Dominion</hi> they meant the Dominion of <hi>ſome Sins</hi> only, and by <hi>total</hi> the Dominion of <hi>all kind of Sins.</hi> That is not their meaning. But that is the full and total, compleat and abſolute Dominion of Sin, when a Man freely peaceably, fully, <hi>(ex ſtudio &amp; ex animo,)</hi> gives up himſelf to any known Sin, whether it be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or not, whether it be open or ſecret. And the <hi>partial Dominion</hi> of Sin (with them) is, when Sin gets Maſtery for a time, when there is not an <hi>actual,</hi> or at leaſt, not a <hi>prevalent Reſiſtance</hi> and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Sin, as to ſome particular Acts; and yet Sin gets not full and peaceable poſſeſſion: but there is the <hi>Spirit luſting</hi> and ſtriving <hi>againſt the Fleſh,</hi> there is a Principle of <hi>Reluctance</hi> to that Sin a Man is drawn to commit; that though at preſent he be worſted by it, yet he yields not up himſelf to it.</p>
            <p>But (as one has the Compariſon) as there are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:92979:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeveral <hi>Forms of Government,</hi> or Dominion, (as <hi>Democracy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Monarchy):</hi> Sometimes the Dominion is exerciſed by many, ſometimes by one alone; yet Subjection to any of them is true <hi>Subjection,</hi> and ſets up Dominion. So though in ſome, more Sins bear rule together, in others, ſome one Sin bears chief rule; yet a <hi>full willing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to Sin, whether one or more, proves the Dominion of Sin.</p>
            <p>Thus though thou keepeſt free from groſs ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sins, yet if thou freely alloweſt thy ſelf to continue in other Sins, in any known Sin, thou art the <hi>Servant of Sin,</hi> and Sin hath Dominion over thee.</p>
            <p>Yea, note further: Thou mayeſt <hi>live in</hi> thoſe Sins, which yet <hi>break not forth</hi> into the outward Act. While Sin hath the Command of the Heart, it hath Dominion. And thus thou art an unclean Perſon who alloweſt thy ſelf, and delighteſt in ſpeculative Wickedneſs, though thou never didſt commit the Act of Uncleanneſs. <hi>Luſting after</hi> a Woman is <hi>committing adultery in the heart,</hi> Mat. 5.28. So thou mayeſt be a meer Senſualiſt, a Swine, a Brute, though thou never drinkeſt unto drunkenneſs, and never eateſt to gluttonous exceſs; if thou only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneſt the pleaſing of thy Appetite and Palate, if thou lookeſt no higher than to the pleaſing of the Fleſh. So Covetouſneſs may be a reigning Sin in thee, though thou art not to be charged with hord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up riches, that ſhould be laid out to the glory of God, and good of others; though thou haſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little of the World in thy poſſeſſion, yet thou mayeſt be a covetous Man, and an Idolater, if thy Heart be full of inordinate love to worldly Riches.</p>
            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:92979:84"/>
            <p n="7">(7.) You may be morally honeſt, juſt in your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, charitable to the poor, your Lives may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with a ſhew of many fair moral Vertues, and yet you may remain under the <hi>Dominion of Sin,</hi> and in an ungodly State. As you may ſtill be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the true <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and without <hi>Love</hi> to God, and may have no care to ſerve him. Sin ſhews and exerciſes its ruling Power and Dominion, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>commanding,</hi> but in <hi>forbidding;</hi> not only in putting Men upon the works of the Fleſh, but in keeping them off from a Courſe of Piety. As one; <hi>If Sin have a negative Voice in your Religion, whether God ſhall be worſhipped and obeyed, or not? it is your King.</hi> Not ſeeking, not ſerving God, is enough to prove thee ungodly. Living in the neglect of known Duty, ſhews Sin to have a <hi>negative Voice</hi> in thee, and that thou chuſeſt to obey Sin, rather than to obey God.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) You may make a fair Profeſſion, yea, may be very <hi>high in Profeſſion,</hi> and yet <hi>under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin.</hi> Luk. 13.25, 26, 27. <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us:—We have eaten and drunk in thy Preſence, and thou haſt taught in our Streets. But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know not whence ye are. Depart from me, all ye Workers of Iniquity.</hi> Viſible Saints may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Workers of Iniquity. Yea, a Man may be not only a ſmooth Profeſſor, but an eminent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and yet a Servant of Sin. There have been <hi>Workers of Miracles,</hi> who for all that were <hi>Workers of Iniquity.</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23. <hi>Judas</hi> was an Apoſtle, and yet a very Slave to the Luſt of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Next I come to give you ſome Notes, whereby you may know whether you are freed from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:92979:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Sin. Only that you may paſs a right Judgment on your State, you muſt take them <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct,</hi> and eſpecially attend to the three laſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If now you are freed from the Dominion of Sin, then certainly you have been made ſenſible what a <hi>miſerable Bondage</hi> it is to be in ſubjection to Sin; you ſee Sin to be the worſt Maſter any Man can ſerve; that to be a Gally-ſlave to the <hi>Turk,</hi> is not ſo bad as to be a Servant to Sin. As I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are all naturally under the Dominion of Sin, and ſo we continue, till we feel what a cruel oppreſſing Tyrant Sin is. We have no will to caſt off its yoke, till we come to be gall'd and pinch'd. Did you never groan under its Oppreſſions? I muſt ſay, that is no good Sign. But if thou canſt no more have a good and favourable thought of the Service of Sin; if thou canſt not but look upon it as a far greater Evil to be given up to thy ſinful Paſſions, to thy corrupt Affections, to be given up to thine own Hearts luſts; I ſay, if thou wouldeſt account this a far greater Evil, than to be given up to the Wills and Luſts of the moſt malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thou haſt, or canſt have in the World; this is an hopeful Sign thou art not a <hi>willing Subject</hi> and Servant of Sin. Thus it was with the Apoſtle, Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Death?</hi> He looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Body of Sin, as a more grievous Burden than all his Bonds, Afflictions, and Sufferings in the Body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So this is an hopeful Sign, when (if you might have your choice) you deſire more to be freed from your Corruptions, than to be exempted from Affliction. If you had rather be kept from Sin,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:92979:85"/>than excuſed from Suffering. And if you can heartily welcom Afflictions, and bleſs God for the ſharpeſt Corrections, may you find them a means of weakning your Corruptions. The Dominion of ſin is chiefly in the <hi>Will.</hi> Now if you care not what you ſuffer here, ſo that ſin may ſuffer this way; if you are willing that God ſhould lay you low in the World, ſo that it may bring down your Pride, and lay your Luſts low; if you could willingly <hi>ſtoop to any Croſs,</hi> to have your old Man, a <hi>Body of Sin crucified on it;</hi> this would ſhew the prevailing bent of your Will is not to ſin, but againſt it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another hopeful Sign that a Man is not under the Dominion of Sin, is, when he would no more <hi>defend</hi> it, no longer take its part. Willing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are ready to <hi>ſtand up</hi> for the defence of their Prince, when others oppoſe him. And when a Man will plead and contend for ſin, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to hear his Sin ſpoken againſt; when his Heart riſeth againſt any faithful Miniſter, or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious Chriſtian, that reproves him, and tells him of the evil of his Sin; when he is an Enemy to ſuch, and takes them for his Enemies that ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſin; does not this ſhew that Sin has the command of him, that he is a willing ſubject to it? But if thou deſireſt to ſee Sin laid out in its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to ſee the vileneſs of it; if thou takeſt it well to be plainly told of any Sin thou haſt been guilty of, and haſt no more an heart to plead for or excuſe it; if thou art willing to hear any thing from God's Word, that makes againſt it, and does no more ſtand for it, but readily takeſt part with the Word againſt it; it is to be hoped thou art <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len off</hi> from Sin, that it has loſt its Dominion.</p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:92979:85"/>
            <p n="4">4. Another hopeful Sign is, if thou wouldeſt no longer maintain its Government by <hi>paying Tribute</hi> to thy Luſts, wouldſt make no more proviſion for them; if thou art for cutting off Proviſions from them, preventing the Occaſions of Sin what thou canſt: But on the contrary, if it is thy care and ſtudy to ſerve and gratify thy Luſts, if thou payeſt Tribute willingly and freely to them; if this is a work, a buſineſs thy Heart is ſet upon, to make proviſion for them; if thou careſt not what charge thou art at to maintain thy Pride; if thou grudgeſt not to lay out to ſerve thy Pleaſure and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſhews thee ſtill under the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin,</hi> that thou art ſo forward to maintain it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is a good Sign, when a Man's will and purpoſe is ſet to withſtand &amp; reſiſt the Motions and Commands of Sin; when he reſolves, ſtrives, watches ordinarily, and prayes earneſtly againſt thoſe Sins which moſt haunt him. As ſuppoſe thou art ſubject to fall into ſinful Paſſion: yet if when thou falleſt into it, thou canſt truly ſay, and the Lord knows, it is beſides and againſt thy purpoſe, it is <hi>the Evil thou wouldeſt not,</hi> it is a thing thou ſeriouſly reſolveſt and ſtriveſt, and crieſt againſt; this ſhews it has not full Dominion. Sin may tyrannize over a Child of God, though it does not reign in him. Where true Grace is, Sin cannot reign, a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully, heartily conſent to obey and be ſubject to it. The Will ſo far as it is renewed and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is againſt it. Indeed through the Remainders of Corruption, and by the Prevalence of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is oft drawn to that which is ſinful; but then he is as one <hi>taken captive,</hi> and his Will is to be free. Where Sin does but <hi>tyrannize,</hi> not <hi>reign,</hi> the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:92979:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>Soul would not be under its Yoke; it wreſtles and ſtruggles to <hi>get free.</hi> And as under the Law; if <hi>the betrothed Damſel</hi> cried out, it was <hi>a Rape,</hi> not the <hi>Sin of Whoredom,</hi> ſhe was <hi>not to dye, if ſhe cryed out,</hi> Deut. 22.26, 27. So Sin is not reigning and mortal, where the Heart and Will is againſt it, the bent and Reſolution of the Soul is againſt it, and the Soul is <hi>crying out earneſtly</hi> for help, though as to <hi>particular Acts</hi> it is oft overcome. It is one thing to <hi>fall into the Dirt,</hi> ſo a Man may do who deſires to keep his Garments clean; and another as the Sow does, with delight to <hi>wallow in the Mire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. This is a ſure Sign that a Man is not under the Dominion of Sin, when his Heart is turned to <hi>hate all known Sin.</hi> As the Apoſtle, though he was not without Sin, yet he was not in love, in league with any Sin; no, it was the <hi>thing he hated. Rom.</hi> 7.15. If thou art an Enemy to Sin, to all known Sin, then certainly thou art not a <hi>willing Subject</hi> to it. A Man would not take and chuſe him for his Maſter whom he hates. If now it is thy great care to ſhun and avoid Sin as an Enemy, and the greateſt Enemy thou haſt in the World; and if thou ſetteſt againſt Sin as thy worſt Enemy, and nothing will ſatisfy thee but the Death of Sin; if thou art daily beſtirring thy ſelf to <hi>beat down a Body of Sin,</hi> to mortify thy earthly Members, to <hi>crucify the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts thereof;</hi> this Hatred and Oppoſition of Sin is one of the cleareſt and beſt Evidences thou canſt have, that thou art not under the Dominion of Sin. And where Sin is not habitually more hated than loved, it has Dominion. But where there is ſuch an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Hatred of Sin,</hi> though remaining In-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:92979:86"/>Corruption prevails too oft, ſo far as to draw a Man to commit the Act of Sin, yet he is not thereupon <hi>reconciled to Sin,</hi> and for a <hi>ſinful Courſe.</hi> But when the Temptation is over, when he comes to himſelf, to act according to the Principle and Habit of Grace within him, he cannot but loath himſelf, and abhor that Sin.

A gracious Soul, though he hath been worſted again and again, will be for <hi>renewing the Fight.</hi> So the Dominion of Sin cannot be concluded from its violent aſſaults on the Soul; but rather one may conclude the contrary, from the <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>hearty Oppoſition</hi> of it. If the Sins which moſt prevail againſt thee, are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt trouble to thee, and nothing in the World would ſo glad thy Heart, as to be rid of them. If the <hi>Pardon of Sin</hi> alone would not ſatisfy thee, without <hi>Power</hi> againſt it; 'tis a good Sign that Sin has not Dominion over thee.</p>

Thou mayeſt know thou art not under the Dominion of Sin, if indeed thou haſt choſen and heartily accepted of a <hi>new Lord;</hi> if thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely reſigned up thy ſelf to God and Jeſus Chriſt. If it be ſo, that Chriſt is now <hi>Lord and Maſter</hi> in thee, then certainly thou art not a <hi>Servant of Sin.</hi> Thou canſt not be under both theſe Maſters.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:92979:87"/>But if now thy Heart and Will is to be governed by God and Chriſt, to come under his Laws, the Government of <hi>Sin</hi> is caſt off.

            <p>More I might add, but I chuſe to conlude with ſome Paſſages out of Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Thus he ſaith,</p>
            <p>— <q>He that ſeldom or never committeth ſuch external Crimes, and yet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not God,

(<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16.) — He that will ſin thus as oft as will ſtand with ſaving Grace, ſhall never have the Aſſurance of his Sincerity, or the Peace or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:92979:87"/>Comfort of a ſound Believer, till he repent and lead a better Life.</q> Again,</p>
            <p>
               <q>He that in his <hi>Sin</hi> retaineth that habitual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, hath alſo habitual vertual Repentance for that very <hi>Sin,</hi> before he actually repenteth; becauſe he hath that habitual Hatred of it, which will cauſe actual Repentance, when he is compoſed to act according to his predominant Habits.—</q> Again,</p>
            <p>
               <q>There are ſome <hi>Sins</hi> which all Men continue in (or the beſt are not freed from) while they live; as Defect in the degrees of Faith, Hope, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vain Thoughts, Words, Paſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where the evil is prevalent in the Will againſt the good, ſo far as to commit thoſe Sins, though not ſo far as to vitiate the Bent of the Heart or Life. —</q> Again,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That which is apprehended to be either of doubtful evil, or but a little ſin, will be much leſs reſiſted, and oftner committed, than Sins that are clearly apprehendeded to be great. — Now if this Apprehenſion be wrong, and come from the predominancy of a carnal or ungodly Heart, which will not ſuffer the Underſtanding to do its Office, nor to take that to be evil, which he would not leave; then both the Judgment, and the Sin occaſioned by it, are mortal, and not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified pardoned Sins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <q>Though it is true, that all good Chriſtians ſhould not indulge the ſmalleſt Sin, and that true Grace will make a Man willing to forſake the leaſt; yet, — No good

The account that is commonly given, why <hi>Love</hi> hath the preheminence of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> is, becauſe of its everlaſting <hi>duration.

Yea, it is <hi>a main part</hi> of our happineſs. And without <hi>perfect Love,</hi> we could not be perfectly happy. There is no perfect enjoying of God, without perfect Love to him, and perfect delight in him.</p>
            <p>And as Chriſt (as <hi>Mediator</hi>) is the <hi>principal means</hi> of bringing us to God; ſo <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>means</hi> to beget, and increaſe the <hi>Love</hi> of God in us. <hi>True Faith worketh this way.</hi> And this is the <hi>end,</hi> and principal ſcope <hi>of the Commandment,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5.</p>
            <p>Whereby it ſufficiently appeareth, that it is a matter of ſo <hi>great concern,</hi> that every one ought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:92979:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſtrictly to inquire, <hi>whether he hath the love of God</hi> in him, or no?</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Love of God</hi> (in ſhort) is an <hi>intenſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God.</hi> More plainly, it is the diſpoſition, or motion of <hi>the Will,</hi> the <hi>rational appetite,</hi> renewed, and rectified by the Holy Spirit, whereby the Soul <hi>cleaveth</hi> to God, is united to him, and fixed on him, as the chiefeſt Good. Or thus, It is a <hi>being well pleaſed with</hi> God above all things in the World, with a <hi>deſire to pleaſe</hi> him in all things.</p>
            <p>The moſt proper, principal, and <hi>formal act of Love</hi> is a <hi>complacency,</hi> or wel-pleaſedneſs with the Object loved. So the <hi>Love of God</hi> (if it be right) is the higheſt <hi>complacency</hi> of the Soul, a being moſt taken with God, as the moſt tranſcendent, as an Univerſal, and <hi>Infinite Good.</hi> And hence, though the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and the <hi>Love of Chriſt</hi> be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; yet they muſt be <hi>diſtinguiſhed.</hi> The <hi>Love of Chriſt</hi> (as Mediator) is the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>principal means</hi> to our <hi>ultimate end,</hi> (as he is the new, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way, by whom we muſt come to God:) but <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>terminated</hi> upon God, as our very <hi>ultimate end,</hi> that we look no further.</p>
            <p>Now to the Queſtion,</p>
            <p>How we may know, <hi>whether we have the Love of God</hi> in us, or no?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) Sound Love to God is founded in a <hi>ſound Knowledg</hi> of God. <hi>(Ignoti nulla cupido.)</hi> There may be ſome knowledg of God, where there is no true Love to him: but there cannot be <hi>Love</hi> to God, where there is <hi>no knowledg</hi> of him. But the <hi>eyes of the underſtanding,</hi> being truly <hi>enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the knowledg of God, by this means the heart comes to be affected. <hi>(Ex aſpectu naſcitur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.)</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:92979:90"/>We read Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> So, they that know his Name (aright) will <hi>ſet their love on</hi> him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Pſal. 91.14. <hi>[Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me]</hi> and <hi>[becauſe he hath known my Name,]</hi> are uſed promiſcuouſly. And ſo the Apoſtle praveth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. that their <hi>love may abound in knowledg.</hi> As the Saints, the more they know God, the more they love him. As in Heaven, where they have the cleareſt <hi>ſight</hi> of Gods <hi>excellencies,</hi> and fulleſt <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation</hi> of his <hi>Love,</hi> there they have <hi>perfect Love</hi> to him, are as full of love to God as their Souls can hold.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of God is founded in <hi>Knowledg.</hi> And there is eſpecially a knowledg of theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> of his <hi>Love</hi> to Man, and of his <hi>lovelineſs,</hi> that makes the ſoul in love with him. <hi>How great is his Goodneſs, and how great is his Beauty,</hi> to enamour us!</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There is a knowledg of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, eſpecially of his <hi>Love in Chriſt.</hi> A knowledg of God in Chriſt, and ſo a love to God in Chriſt. As we read of <hi>love in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. O the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd love of God in Chriſt! Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son</hi>— Rom. 5.8. <hi>Herein God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9, 10. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, &amp;c. Herein is love,</hi> ſuch love was never read, or heard of. What is there in all the World, that ſhould take ſo much with loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as the love of God in providing <hi>ſuch a Saviour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there are ſome, who have <hi>a kind of love</hi> to God, grounded on thoſe outward Mercies, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:92979:91"/>temporal benefits they receive from him, as Health, and Wealth, Plenty and Peace, and temporal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances. Theſe things take more with them than the richeſt offers of Divine Grace. Alas! they are ſo far from a loving, and hearty acceptance of God's Grace in Chriſt, that they moſt ungratefully reject it. Now ſuch as ſlight, and deſpiſe the higheſt expreſſion, and manifeſtation of God's Grace, with what face can they pretend to love God upon this account?</p>
            <p>Others ſpeak ſometimes, as if ſouls muſt <hi>know</hi> their <hi>ſpecial intereſt</hi> in God, and that God loveth them <hi>in ſpecial,</hi> before they can <hi>love</hi> him. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that is a great miſtake. It is true, the <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's Love</hi> is a <hi>ſpecial means</hi> of heightning, and inflaming our love to God; for which end, more than for our own peace, ſatisfaction, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, we ſhould <hi>uſe all diligence</hi> to attain <hi>Aſſurance.</hi> Yet our <hi>firſt Love</hi> is not the <hi>effect</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> but a neceſſary <hi>Antecedent</hi> to it. How can we know, that God <hi>loveth</hi> us with a <hi>ſpecial Love,</hi> till we know, that we are ſuch as believe, and ſuch as love God (as <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?) But though we have not this <hi>particular Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> is there not <hi>ground enough</hi> to love God, that he is <hi>infinitely Good,</hi> and therefore moſt amiable in himſelf? and further, that he hath <hi>ſo loved</hi> us (when moſt unworthy of his love, and fit objects of his wrath; yet that he hath ſo loved us) as to <hi>give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life?</hi> That it is poſſible we may have, yea, certain, that we ſhall have his ſpecial Grace and favour towards us, we coming to him in and through Chriſt; that <hi>in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:92979:91"/>Chriſt</hi> he is <hi>reconciling Sinners</hi> to himſelf; that it is a principal deſign of the Goſpel, and a chief errand, that his Miniſters are ſent upon, to <hi>beſeech Souls to be reconciled to God;</hi> is not this a <hi>drawing with cords of a Man, with bands of Love?</hi> That God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us with ſuch a <hi>demonſtration</hi> of his <hi>Love</hi> and Goodneſs towards ſinners <hi>in general,</hi> ſetting forth a way of Peace, and Reconciliation; Are we not all <hi>bound</hi> upon this account to love God? though all are not preſently to conclude, that they are <hi>elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or that God loves them with a <hi>peculiar Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now have we been <hi>drawn</hi> with theſe <hi>cords</hi> of Divine Love, <hi>ſcil.</hi> God's giving Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of his Love for us, his offering Chriſt to us, and with him all that our Souls can deſire, to make us everlaſtingly happy, if we will but heartily accept of him? Are we <hi>drawn</hi> with this his <hi>lovingkindneſs?</hi> Jer. 31.3. are we overcome of that kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards us?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There is a <hi>Knowledg</hi> of God's Beauty and <hi>Excellencies,</hi> of his moſt glorious, and infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that is to be laid, as the <hi>foundation</hi> of our Love. Thus God will appear moſt amiable. We cannot love him, <hi>as God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quid eſt Deus? Quo nihil melius cogitari pot eſt. <hi>Bern. de conſid. l.</hi> 5.</note> but we muſt love him as moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as <hi>infinite</hi> in all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We muſt ſee all Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in him, and nothing in him but what is excellent. That he is infinitely more worthy to be loved, than any, or all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World, as they all come infinitely ſhort of him; We muſt know, that the virtue and goodneſs found in any creatures, for which they are to be loved, is but as <hi>a drop</hi> of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> (or
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:92979:92"/>not ſo much) compared with his infinite Goodneſs. We muſt ſee ſo much in God, an infinite Fulneſs, and <hi>Alſufficiency,</hi> that there needeth no more to make us for ever happy; while there is a ſcanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>deficiency</hi> in creatures, that we could not be happy in the enjoyment of the whole World without God.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>knowledg of God</hi> admits of <hi>degrees.</hi> And the holieſt, and moſt knowing creature in the World is far ſhort of knowing God <hi>to Perfection.</hi> But ſuch as are <hi>meer ſtrangers</hi> to God, without the true knowledg of God, cannot love him aright. This <hi>Love</hi> is never <hi>blind.</hi> It is impoſſible Men ſhould love God for that, which they ſee not to be in him.</p>
            <p>And ſuch as have very low thoughts of God, (it is plain) neither know him aright, nor truly love him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We may know, we love God in truth, if we <hi>love</hi> him <hi>for himſelf,</hi> and not meerly for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Yet we cannot love God, but we ſhall <hi>love our ſelves.</hi> We cannot love him, but we ſhall deſire, above all things in the World, to be happy in the fruition of him. And is not this to <hi>love our ſelves,</hi> to deſire the greateſt happineſs to our ſelves that we are capable of? And God never requireth this, that we ſhould love him, without ſeeking our own happineſs in him. And further, he is to be loved as our gracious <hi>Benefactor.</hi> Pſal. 116.1. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voice and my ſupplications.</hi> Yet (obſerve) the benefits we do, or hope to receive from him, muſt not be the <hi>only,</hi> or <hi>chief</hi> reaſon of our love.

            <p>Sound Love is not meer <hi>Self-Love.</hi> Love which is <hi>regular,</hi> is not only loving a thing or perſon <hi>good to us,</hi> but loving that which is <hi>good in it ſelf</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have benefit by the ſame or no;) and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame according to the <hi>degree,</hi> and meaſure of goodneſs, which is in it.

The grace of Love is a loving God <hi>for himſelf,</hi> and others <hi>in God, under</hi> him, and <hi>for</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Now that God is to be loved <hi>for himſelf,</hi> hence it follows, that our love is greatly defective, <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> ſinful, when we love him <hi>only,</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> for our ſelves. And this further appears, in that the love of God is a chief and eminent <hi>part of</hi> that <hi>Worſhip</hi> we owe to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſpoken of, as the ſum of all. The love of God is the <hi>abridgement of the firſt Table,</hi> as the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:92979:93"/>love of our Neighbour is the <hi>abridgement of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> But certainly, this is not to glorify God <hi>as God,</hi> to love him but <hi>for our ſelves;</hi> for this is to love our ſelves <hi>more</hi> than God, this is to ſet our ſelves above him, to <hi>deify</hi> our ſelves. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we acknowledge him to be God, we muſt acknowledge him our <hi>ultimate end,</hi> that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and glorifying of God is the great work and chief deſign on which we ought to be moſt intent: whereas to love God but for our ſelves, this is to turn Mans <hi>higheſt ultimate end</hi> into the <hi>rank of a means</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> well noteth.) This is inſtead of ſerving him <hi>as God,</hi> only to ſeek to ſerve our ſelves of him.</p>
            <p>Yet it is granted, that God uſeth the principle of <hi>Self-love</hi> which is naturally implanted in Men, and by this brings on Souls to the love of himſelf, even <hi>for himſelf.</hi> Though there is no greater <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> to the love of God than a baſe, corrupt, <hi>ſinful Self-love</hi> following a corrupt fancy; yet Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love <hi>regulated,</hi> true Self-love, which is according to Reaſon, is no enemy to the love of God. There is a lawful and <hi>regular Self-love,</hi> by which we are led on to the love of God, as beſt in himſelf, and beſt for us. If we truly love our ſelves, it makes way for the love of God, when we are convinced, we can never be truly happy without him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making our choice, our portion, our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our chiefeſt good, eſteeming and deſiring him above all, and loving him even <hi>for himſelf,</hi> and being willing to take up with him alone. And God in himſelf is ſuch an object for our love and complacency, as would <hi>infinitely</hi> delight us, but that our <hi>faculties</hi> are <hi>finite,</hi> as we are our ſelves.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:92979:94"/>And ſuppoſe a Soul to loſe it ſelf (as it were) in the loving admiration of God, ſo as not to have any actual thought or <hi>intention</hi> of its own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet it would be nevertheleſs happy, while ſo taken up with God, and raviſhed in the love and admiring contemplation of him. Its happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (certainly) would not be one jot leſs, for not being <hi>actually</hi> deſigned and looked at, in ſuch holy, heavenly raptures and aſcenſions of the Soul. Thus a right judgment will determine, that God who is <hi>infinite</hi> in all Goodneſs and Perfection, is infinitely more amiable and delectable than our ſelves; and therefore to be loved chiefly <hi>for himſelf,</hi> and <hi>above our ſelves.</hi> And that in loving God above our ſelves, we do moſt truly love our ſelves, as thus we ſhould come to the enjoyment of God, the chiefeſt Good, that which is beſt for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Yet it is further granted, that we are allowed, yea, we ought to love God <hi>for his Benefits.</hi> We muſt both love and praiſe him as the Author of all the Benefits he hath conferred, and that he hath promiſed to confer upon us; only we are not to reſt here, but muſt come on to love him, as the <hi>Ocean</hi> of all Goodneſs, and infinitely amiable in himſelf.</p>
            <p>And this alſo muſt be granted, that Believers who love God for himſelf, and have their hearts carried out towards him, as their <hi>chief ultimate end,</hi> yet can hardly <hi>diſcern it</hi> at firſt, that they love God for himſelf, and above themſelves. The love of our ſelves being more <hi>paſſionate,</hi> is more eaſily felt; and if we go to the <hi>common experience</hi> of Chriſtians, I doubt not but it will tell us, that they were firſt moſt ſenſibly drawn to the <hi>love of God</hi> by a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:92979:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>of <hi>Self-love,</hi> working in a deſire of happineſs, and a fear of miſery. And yet a Man is no ſooner brought home to God, but he is humbled, and aſhamed, that before he was led away ſo with <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Self-love</hi> and inordinate love to Creatures; that he hath not lived in the love of God, nor made it his chief care and ſtudy to pleaſe and glorify God, which is the life he now deſires to lead. He de ſires that now, and for time to come, he may <hi>love God for himſelf,</hi> and be addicted to pleaſe and ſerve God before himſelf; and he would account himſelf more happy, could he find his heart and life brought up to this, than if he might enjoy all the pleaſures and contentments of the whole World. Now, here is the <hi>beginning</hi> of love to God <hi>as God.</hi> And let us be never ſo intent upon our own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet ſo long as we <hi>practically</hi> judge and account our happineſs to conſiſt in the perfect love of God, as infinitely good and perfect, and Gods love to us, here God is made our <hi>ultimate end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for a man to love God as one who (he hopeth) will not damn, or for ever torment him; as one who (he hopeth) will at laſt bring him to an Heaven of he knows not what ſenſitive pleaſures and delights, while he apprehends not at all what the enjoyment of God in Heaven is, while he is without any ſenſe of that <hi>infinite excellency</hi> and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs which is in God, for which he is to be loved above all; and in reſpect of which, Mans neareſt conjunction with him muſt needs be his higheſt felicity; while a Man is a ſtranger to all this he cannot love God <hi>as God</hi> for himſelf, but only for ſome fancied happineſs and ſelf-advantage expected from him.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:92979:95"/>
            <p>
               <hi>[See more of this, and ſo the</hi> Myſtery of the love of God, <hi>and of</hi> our ſelves, <hi>accurately opened in</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Chriſtian Directory, <hi>pag.</hi> 182. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That is a right holy love of God indeed, if we love him, <hi>as an holy God.</hi> And it is not enough to love him, as our great, and gracious <hi>Benefactor;</hi> but we muſt alſo love him, as our Righteous and <hi>Holy Ruler,</hi> and Governor. A Gracious Soul <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> the Lord <hi>for his Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>loves</hi> him even <hi>for his Holineſs:</hi> but graceleſs ones contemn him for the former, and hate him for the latter. Pſal. 119.140. <hi>Thy Word is very pure: therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi> So this is comfortable indeed, if we can ſay the like of God himſelf, if we love him, not only for his <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and Benignity, but alſo for his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and Purity. Fleſh and blood would never teach this. Corrupt nature is contrarily inclined. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners either <hi>ſuppreſs the notion</hi> of God's Holineſs, and take up a moſt falſe, blaſphemous conceit, that God is like to them, and approveth well enough of them, and their wayes, as in Pſal. 50.21. <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf.</hi> Or if they have an apprehenſion of his Holineſs, in that reſpect they love him not, but have a great averſation from him, and contrariety to him. Now it is not being taken with a <hi>falſe Idea,</hi> or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God, which will paſs for <hi>love</hi> to God. This is but ſetting up an <hi>Idol in the heart.</hi> Neither is it enough to love God, as the <hi>God of Nature,</hi> the Creator and Preſerver of all things; He from whom we have our beings, and well-beings; our great <hi>Benefacter,</hi> who <hi>giveth us life, and breath, and all things;</hi> who <hi>giveth us rain from Heaven, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:92979:95"/>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, it is too ſhort to love him, as our Creator and Preſerver: but we muſt love him as our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and <hi>Holy Governor.</hi> Sinners do not take <hi>diſtaſte</hi> at all that is in God, or at all he does: but his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> expreſt in his moſt Righteous, and Holy Laws, this is that <hi>in ſpecial</hi> which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reconciled unto. So they are far from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, as their Holy <hi>Ruler,</hi> and <hi>Judg,</hi> as one that cannot but be diſpleaſed at Sin, which is ſo contrary to his Holy Nature, and to his Righteous Will. They are not ſo much taken with God in any other reſpect, as in this reſpect they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him. But Holineſs is as <hi>eſſential</hi> to God, as any other Attribute of his. Exo. 15.11. <hi>Who is like thee, glorious in Holineſs?</hi> So they that would deprive him of his Holineſs, would ſpoil him of a <hi>chief part</hi> of his Glory. Yea, if he were not Holy, he ſhould not be God. That Sinners who <hi>wiſh</hi> in their hearts that God was not ſo <hi>Holy,</hi> and that his Laws were not ſo ſtrict, or that they might be exempted from his Laws, or from giving account to God; they <hi>interpretatively</hi> wiſh, that there was <hi>no God.</hi> And if it was in their power, it is in their hearts, to dethrone, and <hi>un-God</hi> him. Now ſurely, ſuch are ſo far from loving God, that indeed they are <hi>haters</hi> of God, Rom. 1.30. And well may <hi>his ſoul loath</hi> them, while <hi>their ſouls abhor</hi> him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8. How many (alas!) who love not God for all that he is pleaſed to do for them, as they diſlike him upon this account, that he hath impoſed upon them Laws, that are contrary to their Luſts? ſuch will be found in the <hi>rank</hi> of thoſe that <hi>hate</hi> him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5.</p>
            <p>The love of God, <hi>as our Holy Ruler,</hi> is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:92979:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>that it will nothing advantage a Man, if he ſhould <hi>dy in God's cauſe</hi> (as a <hi>Turk</hi> may chuſe to dye, rather then to deny his <hi>Mahomet:</hi>) If one of us ſhould chuſe to ſacrifice his life, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Religion profeſſed; I ſay, this would not avail at all, while his heart was more for his luſts than for God. As indeed this is not to love God, to prefer any luſt before him, what ever elſe one may part with for him. So</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) If we love God ſincerely, we love him <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parlatively,</hi> we love him above all. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> True love to God will not admit of any corrival with him, will ſuffer nothing to ſtand <hi>in competition</hi> with him. We cannot love him <hi>as God,</hi> if we love any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as much or above him. For a Wife to love her Husband but as ſhe loveth another Man, this is not (in <hi>a moral ſenſe</hi>) to love her Husband, this is not true <hi>conjugal</hi> love. So we do not love God ſin cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>as God,</hi> if we love any thing in the World as much.</p>
            <p>Therefore certainly, they that are <hi>lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more than lovers of God,</hi> (as 2 Tim. 3.4.) and they that <hi>love the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God,</hi> (Joh. 12.43) they that are lovers of the World, and worldly things, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15.) that have their hearts chiefly ſet on theſe things, they are <hi>ſpiritual Adulterers, and Adultereſſes</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calleth them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4.) their <hi>hearts depart, go a whoring</hi> from God. The love of God dwelleth not in them. It <hi>dwells</hi> not where it <hi>rules</hi> not, where it is not predominant, prevailing over <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> ſinful love, and ſubjugating <hi>natural</hi> love; though
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:92979:96"/>they are not totally eradicated here.</p>
            <p>But hereupon ſome ſound upright hearts may be queſtioning the truth of their love to God, not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſtrong <hi>paſſionate workings</hi> in their hearts towards God, which they have towards ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, towards their dear relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſatisfy ſuch: As we diſtinguiſhed before (in ſpeaking of <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi>) there is a <hi>paſſionate</hi> Sorrow, and there is a <hi>rational</hi> Sorrow: ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh of Love, There is a <hi>paſſionate</hi> Love, which may expreſs it ſelf more towards creatures. God being <hi>a Spirit,</hi> is removed further from our ſenſes, and not ſo near unto our paſſions; he is not <hi>directly</hi> the object of a paſſionate Love. But as he is manifeſted, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>enlightned underſtanding,</hi> as moſt amiable, and the chiefeſt Good, the <hi>renewed Will</hi> preferreth, chuſeth, and adhereth to him before all other. And this is a <hi>rational, ſpiritual</hi> Love. Now do we in our ſetled judgment eſteem and prefer, and in our will chuſe and imbrace him before all? Do we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed prize, and deſire an intereſt in him above all things in the World? Had we rather part with all, Poſſeſſions, Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to have no part in him? Should we account our ſelves really miſerable without him, what ever elſe we may enjoy; but happy and bleſt in him, though we were deprived of all worldly comforts? Would an intereſt in God (with us) <hi>weigh down</hi> all the World? This is a ſurer evidence of true love to God, if the ſettled bent, and inclination of our Souls be towards him, than any ſudden <hi>tranſports,</hi> and <hi>flaſhes</hi> of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or paſſionate workings, or raviſhments, that come and go, and leave not the Soul in ſuch a frame.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:92979:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Well, lay up this Note, and try and judg of your ſelves by it. So much as the Will is inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and the Heart ſet upon him <hi>above all things</hi> in the World, ſo much there is of the Grace of Love, ſo far a Soul loveth God in ſincerity.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) If we love God indeed, than we cannot be ſatisfied without an <hi>intereſt in God,</hi> and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but earneſtly deſire to have our intereſt in him cleared to us.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, we muſt know our ſpecial proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him, that he is our God, before we can truly love him. No: but a true love to God is that which muſt evidence God's eſpecial love to us, and our ſpecial intereſt in God. By being ſuch as <hi>love God,</hi> we may know we are in ſpecial relation to him, of the number of thoſe who are <hi>the Called according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. But if we love him indeed, we ſhall long to come to a ſenſe of his love, and to ſee our ſpecial intereſt in him. As the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 119.58. <hi>I intreated thy favour</hi> (thy <hi>face) with my whole heart;</hi> Lord, one good look, one ſmile from thee. A little in the World with God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, would give us more content, than the whole World without it. As the Spouſe ſays, Cant. 6.3. <hi>I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine.</hi> So if God hath our love, we ſhall be reſtleſs, till we can ſay, that <hi>he is ours,</hi> till we can call him <hi>our own.</hi> As they that are <hi>in love,</hi> cannot injoy themſelves, unleſs they may obtain their Beloved. As they ſay, <hi>Love would be paid in its own coin.</hi> If we love God, we cannot be content, unleſs we may <hi>be in his Eyes, as them who find favour.</hi> So we ſhall deſire rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>light of his Countenance,</hi> than the greateſt affluence of worldly comforts, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7.</p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:92979:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But are not moſt of us of another mind? How many that are more intent upon the World to get Eſtates here, than to get an <hi>intereſt</hi> in God? How many who if they may have the World ſmiling on them, never regard though they are under <hi>God's frowns?</hi> How many that ſeek the favour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Men more than the favour of God? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſuch have not the love of God in them.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) If we have the love of God in us, then we ſhall greatly deſire and delight in <hi>his preſence;</hi> and mourn, take on ſadly in his abſence. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water brooks, ſo pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my ſoul after thee, O God.</hi> Pſal. 101.2. <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me!</hi> If we love God we ſhall long for his <hi>gracious viſits.</hi> It will be our delight to <hi>draw nigh</hi> to God in holy Duties, in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and eſpecially when we can find the Lord <hi>drawing nigh</hi> to our Souls; as we are joyed at the coming of a ſpecial friend. And as intimate friends are not content to be long aſunder, we ſhall not be ſatisfied without God's preſence. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>If thy preſence go not with me, carry us not hence.</hi> He would have choſen to be in a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> with God's preſence, rather than to enjoy a <hi>Canaan</hi> without it: ſo if we have the love of God in us, we ſhall rather deſire to be in affliction and have his preſence with us, than to enjoy great worldly proſperity without him. So we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this one of the ſaddeſt afflictions if the Lord withdraws and eſtrangeth himſelf from us, as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> We know not how to bear his frowns. In ſuch a caſe we ſhall have many ſad and ſerious ſelf-reflections, often asking our Souls,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:92979:98"/>What is the matter? what have we done that the Lord takes unkindly, that has ſet him at <hi>ſuch a diſtance?</hi> We ſhall not reſt till we have found out the cauſe, and removed it; till this <hi>ſad breach</hi> be made up, and we reſtored to our communion with God. If indeed our hearts be with him, we can no longer <hi>enjoy our ſelves</hi> than we enjoy him. A ſoul that loves God cannot but ſay, <hi>It is not good,</hi> Lord, for me <hi>to be alone;</hi> counting it an <hi>Heaven upon Earth</hi> to enjoy him, but <hi>an Hell</hi> to live <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him in the World.</hi> As the <hi>Needle touch'd with the Loadſtone</hi> will be turning to ſuch a point; the Heart being touch'd with the love of God will be moving and inclining towards him, it cannot reſt but in the enjoyment of him: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee.</hi> Such a ſoul is in a trembling poſture, and is fainting for him, when the Lord carrieth more ſtrange, when he <hi>hides his face,</hi> Pſal. 84.2. <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord. My heart and my fleſh crieth out for the living God, my ſoul even fainteth.</hi> This is <hi>Love's ſickneſs.</hi> Are we thus <hi>ſick of Love,</hi> as the Spouſe was, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8. There is a <hi>lamenting love</hi> as well as a <hi>delighting love.</hi> As the Child crieth for its Mother. As we are grieved at the loſs, or long abſence of a dear friend. <hi>Abſence</hi> is the <hi>Lover's night.</hi> God's abſence makes the darkeſt and faddeſt night to the ſouls of his People. <hi>[My ſoul fainteth for the Courts of the Lord,]</hi> becauſe there he was wont to have <hi>fights</hi> of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.2. there he was wont to enjoy ſweet communion with him. And <hi>[my heart and my fleſh crieth out for the living God.]</hi> He would ſend his hearty and carneſt cries after him. So if we love God, we ſhall ſeek him
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:92979:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtill, though he be a God that ſometimes <hi>hideth himſelf,</hi> Iſa. 45.15. Thus the Spouſe ſhewed how her heart went after her Beloved, whenſhe <hi>ſought him in the ſtreets of the City,</hi> ſought him <hi>in the broad ways,</hi> Cant. 3.2. went about up and down ſeeking him, and could not reſt till ſhe had found him. As they ſhewed how they were taken with their <hi>Idols,</hi> Jer. 8.2. <hi>Whom they have loved, and whom they have ſerved, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have ſought.</hi> By love the Soul is <hi>knit</hi> to the Lord, and cleaveth to him, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12.) and it muſt needs go fore with ſuch a ſoul to be parted, to be ſeparated from him. Nothing in the World can be more grievous to it.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) If we have the love of God in us while we are our ſelves, are in our <hi>right frame,</hi> and act like our ſelves, we are breathing after and <hi>longing</hi> for the <hi>full enjoyment</hi> of God in Glory. We deſire and are glad of his preſence with us here, yet are not ſatisfied therewith, but ſet a longing after Heaven, where our love to God ſhall be perfect, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him more immediate, and our joy in him full; ſo if we love God, how ſhould we <hi>love the appearing of Chriſt!</hi> (2 Tim. 4.8.) how ſhould we rejoyce to think of the day when Chriſt will come, and <hi>take us up to himſelf,</hi> to enjoy God in Glory! If it be ſo deſirable to enjoy his preſence here, how much more to enjoy his preſence in Heaven. So this would ſhew that we love God, if we are <hi>looking for and haſting unto the coming of the day of God,</hi> (as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12.) and if we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily lament it, that we are at ſo great a diſtance from him, that we enjoy ſo little of him, and deſire the cleareſt manifeſtation of his love, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:92979:99"/>fellowſhip with, and fulleſt fruition of him, above all the riches, pleaſures and honours in the World: Then certainly we are taken with him.</p>
            <p>Yet it is granted, many times ſuch as have the love of God in them cannot find in themſelves ſuch willingneſs to <hi>be abſent from the Body, to be preſent with the Lord,</hi> as would become them, and which they would attain unto. But generally it is becauſe they are clouded, and full of doubts and fears about their ſpiritual eſtates; or becauſe they are conſcious of preſent great unpreparedneſs, they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo unmeet for Heaven. They are aſhamed that the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> ſhould come and find them ſo unready. But yet they would not <hi>build Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and ſet up their reſt here. They could not be content with the World for <hi>their Portion,</hi> might they always enjoy it. They look higher. And if they may not hope at laſt to come to the enjoyment of God in Heaven, they muſt deſpair of ever being as they would be.</p>
            <p>But alas! how many are there who might they but have their lives perpetuated here, and ſo enjoy the World for ever, would never think of Heaven, would deſire <hi>no other Heaven!</hi> and when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Heaven, it is only in a <hi>ſecond place,</hi> when they can enjoy the World no longer; but if they were put to their choice, they would not leave Earth for Heaven. And they deſire not Heaven at all, for the enjoyment of God there, and to live in the perfect love of God and full conformity to him; but only to be free from trouble, and ſecured from the pains and torments of Hell, and to enjoy a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of delights to pleaſe their ſenſes. The Heaven that cornal minds are for, is <hi>but a dream,</hi> a fancy of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:92979:99"/>their own. That which is the <hi>Heaven of Heavens, ſcil.</hi> the full enjoyment of God in his love and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they have no mind to.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) If we have ſet our love upon God, then our <hi>thoughts</hi> are much upon him. Thus the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt proved his love to the Word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>O how I love thy Law! it is my meditation all the day.</hi> As he ſays, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Thy Teſtimonies alſo are <hi>my delight.</hi> Where the <hi>Septuagint</hi> read, <hi>my meditation.</hi> It was his delight to meditate on them. Thus his love to God was acting in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and moſt pleaſing contemplations of God. As it is the covetous Worldling's delight to think on his riches, and the Senſualiſt's delight to think on his pleaſures; ſo <hi>his meditation of God was ſweet</hi> to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.34. which ſhewed his love to God. As the Lover delights to behold the party with whom he is enamoured. The thoughts of the ſoul are its <hi>glances,</hi> and ſerious meditations, its <hi>fixed looks.</hi> And if we have ſet our love upon him, our moſt intent and powerful affecting thoughts are fixed on him. Our beſt, our moſt <hi>deliberate,</hi> adviſed (if not our moſt frequent) thoughts are on God. The ſoul is where it <hi>loves,</hi> rather than where it <hi>lives.</hi> You may be in company with one that is <hi>deep in love,</hi> you may talk to him, and yet he little minds you or your diſcourſe; his thoughts are elſewhere taken up with <hi>his beloved.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you ſee one mindleſs of his buſineſs, you will oft ſay, ſurely he is <hi>in love.</hi> So indeed the the ſoul that loves God is much with him in its thoughts. As the Pſalmiſt would <hi>remember him upon his bed, and meditate on him in the night-watches.</hi> And (ſayes he) <hi>when I awake, I am ſtill with thee.</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:92979:100"/>Thus one that loves God will ordinarily have his thoughts on God, both lying down at night and riſing up in the morning. So when he is at work in his Calling, his thoughts are ever and anon aſcending up to God. And when he is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he oft leaves his Company uneſpyed, his heart and thoughts going out after God. But now, when it is ſo, that a Man does what he can to baniſh God out of his thoughts, when the thoughts of God are <hi>unwelcome gueſts,</hi> are not kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, when God is not in all his thoughts from morning to night, at leaſt not with his good will, ſurely ſuch a one does but vainly pretend to love God. How canſt thou ſay that <hi>thou loveſt him, when thy heart is not with him,</hi> when thy thoughts are not on him? Such as love not to think on him, it is plain they are great <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> or rather <hi>enemies</hi> to God in their minds.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) If we love God, we ſhall delight to ſpeak or hear of him, to put us in mind of him, or to ſet forth his praiſe. It will be pleaſing to us to <hi>hear of God,</hi> and the things of God, if we hear the things that are right. To hear his Word, and to hear Men <hi>ſpeak well</hi> of him according to his Word. So we ſhall delight as to think on his Name, ſo to <hi>make mention</hi> of his Name. Though we ſhall dread to ſpeak ſlightly, careleſsly of him, though we ſhall abhor the abuſing and profaning of his ſacred and reverend Name, we ſhall deſire to ſpeak reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and affectionately of him. <hi>Out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> Where the heart is full of love to the World, a Man's delight will be to ſpeak of worldly things, ſuch as he loves moſt. And he cannot reliſh other diſcourſes, but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:92979:100"/>it ſounds harſh, is unpleaſing to him. On the contrary, when the heart is taken up with the love of God, it will be ones delight to ſpeak of him, and to ſpeak in his praiſe, to <hi>ſpeak good of his Name.</hi> As we are forward upon all occaſions to ſpeak in the commendation of thoſe whom we moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo if we love God we ſhall be ſpeaking well of him, we are oft ſetting forth his goodneſs, we love to ſpeak of his excellencies and of his glory.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) If we love God, it will be a <hi>great grief</hi> to us to ſee or hear God diſhonoured; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me.</hi> He took them to himſelf: Yea, to hear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vilified, would not have moved him ſo much. When <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him, he could hear and bear it patiently. So if we love God, we ſhall be <hi>grieved at thoſe that riſe up againſt God,</hi> (with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22.) we ſhall count thoſe our enemies that are enemies to God. Who could endure to ſee his friend abuſed, to ſee his Father wronged? If we have the love of God in us, our indignation will be moved when we hear the Name of God profaned, and ſee his Majeſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, his Laws violated, his truth and intereſt oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Now what ſay you to this? If you can be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough of any <hi>injury</hi> done to your ſelves, but no way touched or affected with the great <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities</hi> you oft ſee and hear offered unto God: If you can ſee Sinners (as it were) <hi>flying in God's face,</hi> and yet remain ſenſleſs and <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi> having nothing to ſay in God's cauſe (as the Pſalmiſt was <hi>dumb in his own cauſe,</hi> Pſal. 38.14.) <hi>as a Man that beareth not, and in whoſe mouth are no reproofs.</hi> If
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:92979:101"/>you can have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with Sinners, delight in their company, and rather countenance than diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Ungodly, and <hi>love them that hate the Lord:</hi> will theſe things ſhew any love to God? Would you take him for <hi>your friend</hi> that could ſee others evil intreat you, and yet ſtood by as one wholly unconcerned? And can you be friends with thoſe who ſhew themſelves enemies to God, and no way manifeſt your diſpleaſure againſt them and their evil ways? and will you yet pretend to love God?</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) If we love God, we have a deſire to win and draw in others to him. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> When ſhe was drawn, ſhe would be for drawing others to him. She was not content to come <hi>alone,</hi> but would endeavour to bring in others with her. As the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.3. <hi>O magnify the Lord with me.</hi> — So one that loves God will be ready to call upon others. <hi>O love the Lord with me!</hi> O ſerve the Lord with me! If we have the love of God in us, it will grieve us to ſee others enemies to God. (As the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the tranſgreſſours, and was grieved.</hi>) And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it will be our grief, to ſee any of ours alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from God, to ſee any of our friends <hi>enemies to God,</hi> any of our Relations, ſuch as are near to us afar off from God, to ſee any of our Children back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to that which is good, <hi>Children of diſobedience,</hi> carrying ſo that we may know they have not the love of God in them. We ſhall be earneſt with God in Prayer, that he would change their hearts, that he would circumciſe their hearts to love him. What is it that we would <hi>chuſe</hi> for ours, if we might have <hi>our choice?</hi> Whether would we chuſe God or the World? Had we rather ſee them in a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:92979:101"/>ſtate of Grace and in favour with God, though they were never ſo poor and low in the World, than ſee them rich and graceleſs? And would we in the firſt place acquaint them with God? Are we ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, perſwading, charging them to come in to him?</p>
            <p>If we are leſs afraid of <hi>diſpleaſing God</hi> by a <hi>ſinful ſilence</hi> here, than of diſpleaſing them by plain and faithful dealing with them; is not this to <hi>honour them above the Lord?</hi> And if we can be well enough pleaſed with Children, though we cannot ſee the leaſt ſpark of Grace in them; if they are but likely to thrive and proſper in the World; and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not though our Servants are backward to God's Service, while they follow our buſineſs cloſe, if we take no pains with them to get them better principled: ſuch things would ſhew as little <hi>love to God</hi> as to their ſouls.</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) If the love of God be in us, then we are no longer <hi>in love</hi> or <hi>in league with Sin.</hi> Pſal. 97.10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.</hi> How can we love God who is <hi>Holineſs it ſelf,</hi> and yet be in love with Sin that is ſo contrary to God? He that loves his Prince, hates Treaſon and Rebellion againſt his Prince. He that loves his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">Ubi regnat charitas, non regnat cupiditas. <hi>Lud. Carthuſ.</hi>
               </note> does not delight to walk croſs to his Father. The <hi>predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant love</hi> of God, and <hi>reigning Sin,</hi> are things utterly inconſiſtent. If we love God, we cannot but hate and dread that which would <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> betwixt us and our God. Here I may allude to that Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.4, 6, 8. <hi>Ye ſhall walk after the Lord your God, and cleave to him.</hi> And <hi>if thy friend which is as thine own ſoul entice thee ſecretly,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:92979:102"/>ſaying, Let us go and ſerve other gods,—Thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither ſhall thine eye pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare, neither ſhalt thou conceal him: But thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, thine hand ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to death.</hi> So if we <hi>love God</hi> and <hi>cleave</hi> to him, we ſhall not be for <hi>concealing</hi> and <hi>ſparing</hi> any ſin, how dear ſo ever it may have been, though it hath been as <hi>a right Eye,</hi> or as <hi>a right Hand</hi> to us; we ſhall no longer connive at any <hi>Darling Luſt</hi> that would entice and draw away our hearts from God, we ſhall be reſolved on the <hi>mortifying</hi> and <hi>crucifying</hi> of it. The <hi>love of God,</hi> and <hi>friendſhip with Sin,</hi> will not ſtand together.</p>
            <p>Oh! think ſeriouſly of this: While thou art <hi>wedded</hi> to any luſt, to thy Pride, to thy Fleſh-pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Senſuality, or to thy Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thy heart is not with God. Thou canſt not cleave to God and Sin both. Thou canſt not be for <hi>two Maſters</hi> ſo contrary; but if thou <hi>loveſt the one,</hi> thou muſt needs <hi>hate the other;</hi> if thou <hi>cleaveſt to</hi> the one, thou muſt needs <hi>forſake</hi> the other. If thou <hi>loveſt evil more than good,</hi> (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.3.) if thou art ſo far linkt in, and in league with any luſt, that thy Will is more for keeping than for parting with it, more for ſerving and gratifying than for ſubduing and crucifying it, the love of God is not in thee.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) If we love God, then it is our delight to ſerve and obey him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> v. 6. <hi>This is love, that we walk after his Commandments.</hi> To <hi>love</hi> him, and <hi>keep his Commandments</hi> are joyned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.5.

<note place="margin">Nunquam eſt Dei Amor otioſus. Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur etenim magna, ſi eſt: Si vero opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri renuit, Amor non eſt. (<hi>Gregor. Mag.

            <p>Now if we are more for pleaſing our ſelves than for pleaſing God, more for having our own wills than for <hi>doing the will</hi> of God; if we are more at Mens command, at the command of the World, than we are at God's command, and that <hi>habitually</hi> and ordinarily, it is plain, we prefer our ſelves and honour the Creature above God; and while it is thus, how can we ſay that we love him?</p>
            <p>If we love God, we ſhall follow him, and love to <hi>walk in his ways.</hi> As they ſaid of their <hi>Idols,</hi> Jer. 2.25. <hi>I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I go.</hi> Had they loved God indeed, they would have been for following him and not ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>counſel</hi> of a ſpecial friend is much regarded: and ſurely, if we <hi>love</hi> God we ſhall not <hi>deſpiſe his counſels. Pſal.</hi> 119.128. <hi>I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right.</hi> He approved of them all, he would not have any one of God's Laws nulled and abrogated.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:92979:103"/>
               <hi>walk ever in his ways, Deut.</hi> 19.9. So the love of God will incline ſouls to ſincere, impartial, and conſtant obedience.</p>
            <p n="14">(14.) If we love God, we ſhall deſire to be more like him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be followers of God, as dear Children;</hi>

We may not act for our own glory, as God does. This would entrench upon the glory due from us to God, and croſs the end of our beings. Yet if we love God, we ſhall deſire to be like him ſo far as we may. There is an <hi>aſſimulating</hi> vertue and power in love. We are ready to imitate thoſe we love. Their <hi>example</hi> is very moving, and is wont to take much with us. If we love God, we ſhall deſire that we may have <hi>hearts after his heart,</hi> to love that which he loves, and to hate that which he hates <hi>(Amicorum idem velle, &amp; idem nolle:)</hi> We ſhall deſire to be <hi>holy as he is holy,</hi> and merciful as he is merciful, and perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect. Though it is impoſſible for any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be <hi>as holy,</hi> as merciful, as perfect as God is. Though an <hi>equality</hi> here is not to be thought of; yet a <hi>likeneſs</hi> and ſimilitude, a conformity to God in our meaſure, ſuch as we may attain to, we muſt ſtudy and endeavour, and this the love of God would put us upon.</p>
            <p>But if we rather wiſh that God was altogether <hi>ſuch a one</hi> as our ſelves, if we rather deſire that he would come down to us, and comply with, allow of our crooked Tempers and Manners, than to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:92979:103"/>have our ſouls raiſed up to him, by the reſtoring of his <hi>Image,</hi> and a <hi>divine Nature</hi> wrought in us, it would ſhew indeed that we are little taken with him, but rather (how little cauſe ſoever there is for it) we are ſtill in love with our ſinful ſelves.</p>
            <p n="15">(15.)

We ſet a value on Mercies, according as God's love appears in them. When <hi>Tamar</hi> had got <hi>Judah</hi>'s Signet and Bracelets, ſhe would not part with them for a Kid. One would have prized a <hi>kiſs of</hi> Cyrus above the <hi>golden Cup</hi> he gave him. The ſoul that loves God, will value ſpiritual Mercies above tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral enjoyments. The <hi>conſolations of God</hi> will not be <hi>ſmall</hi> in ſuch a ones account. His comforts will be more deſired, longed for; or if enjoyed, will more delight and refreſh the ſoul, than any worldly comforts. And the more we love God, the more we ſhall praiſe him for any intimations and expreſſions of his love. We ſhall <hi>delight to tell</hi> others what <hi>he hath done for our ſouls;</hi> as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 103.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>This would in part ſhew we love God <hi>for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> and not only for his Benefits, if indeed we ſet the higheſt value and account on thoſe Benefits, wherein we might read his <hi>ſpecial love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they that would account more of the <hi>Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> than of the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and ſet more ſtore by <hi>Corn and Wine</hi> than they could do by the <hi>light of God's Countenance,</hi> ſhew little love to God.</p>

We ſhall be ready to juſtify God, and to condemn our ſelves, acknowledging God to be righteous, and to puniſh leſs than our iniquities deſerve. If we <hi>cry</hi> to God, and he ſeem not to hear, we ſhall not hereupon <hi>take pett,</hi> but conclude with the Pſalmiſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.2, 3.) <hi>Yet thou art holy.</hi> Indeed we ſhall be ready in our troubles to <hi>complain to</hi> him (as we uſe in trouble to complain to our friends) but we would not <hi>complain of</hi> him. If we love God, Afflictions will not ordinarily <hi>drive us from</hi> God, but rather drive us nearer to him. If he ſhews his diſpleaſure, it will grieve us moſt that we have diſpleaſed him, that we have offended our good and gracious Father, that we have provoked the God of Patience, a God ſo rich in Mercy. And ſo we ſhall be for humbling our ſelves, and making our peace with him.</p>

            <p>But if when we are afflicted, inſtead of <hi>accepting of the puniſhment of our Iniquities,</hi> and humbling our ſelves, and ſeeking his face, our hearts do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>fret againſt the Lord,</hi> we are <hi>ſtrange Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. We have had Fathers of our fleſh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence; and if we are</hi> not much rather <hi>in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits,</hi> we ſhew not a childlike diſpoſition. And how ſad is it, if in our afflictions we are ready to ſay, with him of whom we read, <hi>This evil is of the Lord: why ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer?</hi> How ſad is it, when Croſſes, that ſhould crucify and deaden our hearts more to the World, have this contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, deadning them towards God, and towards holy Duties? That we have leſs heart to ſerve God, have leſs heart to Pray, to Read and Hear the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is noted of the Hypocrite, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.9, 10. <hi>When trouble comes upon him, will he delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">(17.) If we love God indeed, we ſhall deſire to love him more and more, and to expreſs our love more and more. We ſhall never think we love him enough, or that we do enough for him, or that what we do in God's ſervice at any time, is done well enough. It will be our unfeigned deſire to honour God more, and to ſerve him better. As the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, 71.14. <hi>I will yet praiſe thee more and more.</hi> Love in the Heart, will ſet the Head on contriving, the Tongue on pleading, the Hands on working for God. <hi>Love is kind, is bountiful. Amicorum omnia communia.</hi> If we have the Love of God in us, we ſhall deſire, that all we have may be at his ſervice, that our parts, intereſt, eſtate may be imploy'd, and improved for him. Love to God will put us upon
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:92979:105"/>
               <hi>holy Projects</hi> for God. As it is very pleaſing to us, to ſerve a ſpecial Friend; it will be our joy and delight to ſerve God, to act for his Glory, to do any thing to promote his intereſt. And ſuch as abound in Love to God, will alſo <hi>abound in the work of the Lord.</hi> Whereas a Soul without Love, is like a <hi>Bird</hi> that has <hi>loſt his Wings,</hi> or like a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot without Wheels,</hi> it moves very heavily. What ſuch may ſeem to do for God, is done without heart, with no alacrity, or delight, but rather with pain and trouble, further than <hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-love</hi> carries them out.</p>
            <p>Thus if what is done for God, be done grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and if we are weary of his ſervice, and if we are ſetting our ſelves bounds, and think we have done enough already, theſe things would not ſhew any love to God.</p>
            <p n="18">(18.) If we love God, it will be a joy to us, to ſee others <hi>active for God.</hi> Though we ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to think how little we have done for God, though it will grieve us that we can do no more; yet withall it will be a <hi>pleaſing ſight</hi> to us, when we can ſee his Intereſt and Honour promoted, and advanced, be it by others. Though we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in our places to do as much as thoſe, that do moſt for God; yet it will be no <hi>eye-ſore</hi> to us, when we ſee others out-ſtripping us. We ſhall honour them the more, and ſhall deſire to imitate them: we ſhall not envy, or ſtomach them.</p>
            <p>But if we are offended at thoſe that are more forward, and zealous, if we grudg that any cloud us by their <hi>ſhining brighter,</hi> if we have a ſecret diſlike of thoſe that excell in Holineſs, and Vertue, and quite <hi>out-do</hi> us in the ſervice of God; though the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:92979:105"/>Lord hath more honour by them; this is an ill ſign, a ſign that we prefer our own intereſt before Gods intereſt, and prefer our own reputation, before his Glory; and ſo that we love him not as we ought.</p>
            <p n="19">(19.) If we love God, we ſhall be ready not only to <hi>act,</hi> but to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for him too. Be willing to ſuffer any thing for God, rather than forſake him. <hi>Amanti nihil difficile.</hi> Love makes any croſs tolerable. They that <hi>endure temptation,</hi> or trial, and <hi>they that love God,</hi> are made all one, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. True Love is <hi>fugatrix timoris, et animatrix confeſſionis,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Tertul.) Many Waters cannot quench Love.</hi> Where this divine ſpark is kindled, it oft flameth forth more, the more it meeteth with oppoſition. It is intended by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> as Fire burns hotteſt in cold, froſty weather. How oft have the Faithful rejoyced in tribulation, gloried in their ſufferings? Though we are not to <hi>run upon</hi> Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings uncalled; yet how many have counted it à joy, and pleaſure, when they have <hi>fallen into</hi> them? I grant, ſome may be carried on to ſuffer for God, and his Truth, who are only <hi>animated</hi> with <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,</hi> or with a vain, proud conceit of meriting highly by their ſufferings; and not with a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of Love. Yet that Mans Love to God is to be ſuſpected, or rather concluded unſound, that will not carry him through ſufferings, and tryals here. He that loveth Father, or Mother, Wife, or Children, Liberty, or Eſtate, or Life it ſelf, more than God, does not love him ſincerely. If we had rather incur God's diſpleaſure, than Man's; had rather forgo an intereſt in God, than forgo Eſtates in the World for him; if we had rather venture on an everlaſting ſeparation from God, than lay down
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:92979:106"/>our lives here for him; ſurely, we care little for him.</p>
            <p n="20">(20.) If we love God, we ſhall love others <hi>for his ſake.</hi> Love all Men, love Enemies, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially love the Godly for his ſake. The Love of God includes under it the Love of our Neighbour, and Love of the Brethren. As it is well defined, thus, <q>It is a Grace, whereby we love God for himſelf above all, and all others for God, and in God.</q> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20, 21. <hi>If a Man ſay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a liar, &amp;c.</hi> And this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have we from him, <hi>that he who loveth God, loveth his Neighbour alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I ſhould ſay ſomething of Love to Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Love to Men <hi>in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of Love to Enemies in <hi>particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Of Love to the Godly <hi>in ſpecial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Love of God will incline the heart to <hi>love all Men:</hi> As it is a thing that God requires; And as there is ſomething of God to be ſeen in all Men; Yea, more than in Sun and Moon, or the moſt excellent Creatures in the World, that are without life, and void of Reaſon. All Men are worthy of our love, as they are God's Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as they are <hi>reaſonable Creatures,</hi> and capable of enjoying God, and Happineſs, though ſuch in a ſpecial manner are worthy of our love, who are more eſpecially God's workmanſhip, being <hi>created again</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Damned</hi> are none of our <hi>Neighbors,</hi> but removed quite out of all ſociety with us, and out of all capacity of ever loving, and enjoying God. And ſuch as have ſinned unto Death, if we can certainly know them, we may know to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:92979:106"/>
               <hi>outlaw'd,</hi> and loſt Creatures to all Eternity, for whom there remains nothing but a certain fearful expectation of Judgment, and fiery Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries.</p>
            <p>But (excepting ſuch) do we bear an <hi>univerſal Good-will</hi> to Men for God's ſake? with reſpect to his holy VVill, and Command, and to his Honour and Glory?</p>
            <p>Then certainly, it will be our Prayer, and <hi>hearts deſire,</hi> that his way may be known upon Earth, his ſaving health among all Nations.</p>
            <p>And then we cannot but pity thoſe that <hi>ſit in darkneſs, and in the region and ſhadow of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then we ſhall have aking and <hi>bleeding hearts</hi> for thoſe, that enjoy the Goſpel and ordinary means of Salvation, but plainly <hi>reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> and will not attend to the <hi>things of their peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it will affect us with grief and horrour, to ſee ſinners poſting on in the broad way to Hell and Deſtruction. As the Pſalmiſt 119.53. <hi>Horrour hath taken hold upon me, becauſe of the wicked that forſake thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it would greatly rejoyce our hearts, might we be a means of ſtopping any ſuch in their deſperate career, a means of <hi>converting</hi> any Sinner <hi>from the errour of his way,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>ſaving a ſoul from death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what ſhould they think of themſelves who are wholly unconcerned; I mean, carry as not at all concerned how it goes with the Souls of others? Such as would ſay (with <hi>Cain) Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> Such as make no conſcience at all of, but groſly neglect that plain and neceſſary duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:92979:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sinners, though they have never ſo loud a call, and never ſo fair opportunity. Are not they ſaid to <hi>hate their Brother in their heart,</hi> that will not <hi>rebuke,</hi> but <hi>ſuffer Sin upon him?</hi> So what enemies are they to Souls, that are enemies to the Goſpel, and the faithful preaching of it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15, 16. True love wiſheth the beſt good to Men, and ſo the means of it, without which it is not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obtained.</p>
            <p>But though ſound love reſpecteth the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, and their ſpiritual welfare <hi>chiefly,</hi> yet not <hi>only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, Are we far from envying others proſperity? <hi>Charity envieth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.</p>
            <p>Are we grieved for others calamities? As the Pſalmiſt, 35.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Is it our deſire not to be wanting in any <hi>Office of</hi> love to others?

            <p>And are we for ſetting aſide all baſe <hi>ſelf-reſpect,</hi> in the love we bear, and the good we do to others? Are we willing to do good to ſuch, as either will not or cannot recompence us? Do we not ſome way aim at our <hi>own ends,</hi> advantage, praiſe, <hi>&amp;c. Charity ſeeketh not her own.</hi> To love another but <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>with reſpect to</hi> our ſelves, is not properly to love another, but only to love our ſelves. But if we can find our hearts going out in love, and good-will towards all Men, (though we cannot expect ſo
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:92979:107"/>much as <hi>thanks</hi> from one of many) this is very comfortable.</p>
            <p>But here you may ask,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Should we not (with the Pſalmiſt, 139.21, 22.) <hi>hate the wicked?</hi> How than are we to love all Men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As we are to loath, and <hi>abhor our ſelves,</hi> ſo far as we are ſinful, and yet notwithſtanding we muſt <hi>love</hi> our ſelves; ſo we are both to <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> the wicked. As God hath <hi>a love</hi> to them, <hi>as his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and many ways is doing good to them, whom yet <hi>he hates,</hi> as they are wicked: So muſt we. In hating a ſinner, we muſt neither <hi>hate his nature for his ſin,</hi> (as one notes) nor <hi>his ſin for the Man:</hi> but <hi>hate</hi> Sin <hi>as ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burgeſs.</hi> Chain of Graces. p. 239.</note> and <hi>love</hi> the Man, conſidered <hi>as a Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Phyſical,</hi> or natural goodneſs, which is found in wicked Men as they are Men, which includes in it a <hi>capableneſs</hi> of <hi>moral</hi> goodneſs; for which they are ſo far to be eſteemed, and loved. And while the wicked are in <hi>a poſſibility</hi> of being reclaimed from their wickedneſs, we muſt pity, pray for, and heartily wiſh well unto them, and indeavour to promote their Converſion, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as it may lye in our way to contribute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Is it not ſometimes lawful, to imprecate God's Vengeance on the wicked?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not to be done <hi>ordinarily. Firſt of all</hi> Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions muſt be made for all Men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. Contrary to the cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> notes) who uſe to curſe the Heathen, and pray for none but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:92979:108"/>themſelves, and thoſe of their own Nation, and Religion. In praying for all, we ſhould pray for the wicked, that God would reſtrain, convince, and convert them (if it be his will.) If we pray, that <hi>God's hand</hi> may <hi>find out his enemies, his right hand thoſe that hate him,</hi> it muſt be <hi>conditionally;</hi> that is, If they be incurable, incorrigible, implacable, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in their malice againſt God, his Church, and Intereſt. Before we pray <hi>abſolutely</hi> againſt any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, we ſhould look well to our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. <hi>Charity hopeth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. while we cannot <hi>certainly know,</hi> or pronounce ſuch <hi>without all hope of mercy,</hi> we ſhould not dare in our prayers to <hi>devote</hi> them <hi>to Juſtice.</hi> What ſome holy Men have done here, as <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> ſeems to be <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, Spiritu praevidentis, non voto optantis,</hi> from a <hi>ſpirit of Propheſie,</hi> rather than from the <hi>ſpirit of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi> Unleſs we had <hi>their ſpirit,</hi> we have not their <hi>warrant,</hi> to pray <hi>directly</hi> againſt any Mens perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. May not the righteous ſometimes <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, ſeeing Gods Vengeance on the wicked,</hi> as Pſal. 58.10?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As God is <hi>glorified</hi> by the <hi>Judgment which he executeth,</hi> and as it may tend to promote his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and the good, and ſafety of his Church and People, ſo they may <hi>rejoyce,</hi> at the cutting off and fall of wicked, and miſchievous Inſtruments: but may not rejoyce meerly in their deſtruction. Not as it <hi>makes againſt them;</hi> but as it makes <hi>for Gods Glory,</hi> and the good of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Is it not lawful to deſire that Juſtice may be done on notorious offenders? Now is this to love them, to <hi>will their puniſhment?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:92979:108"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We may deſire that ſuch may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>without breach of Charity.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="1">1. When it is not from any <hi>private grudge,</hi> but from a <hi>love to publick juſtice,</hi> and <hi>with reſpect</hi> to the glory of God thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we have reſpect to the <hi>good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</hi> As we owe more love to the <hi>publick Society</hi> of which we are Members, than to particular Members in the Society, and much more then to corrupt <hi>gangren'd</hi> Members, that endanger the whole Body. When great notorious crimes go unpuniſhed, the Community may ſuffer for it. <hi>Blood deſiles a Land;</hi> ſo Whoredom, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And where Men care not to let ſuch ſins go unpuniſhed, it provokes the Lord to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh for them. It is better that the Offenders ſhould ſuffer puniſhment, than the whole Body ſhould ſuffer for them. Again, when great crimes go unpuniſhed, more are encouraged to commit them. That this is a <hi>ſparing cruelty.</hi> There is <hi>Credulitas parcens,</hi> and there is <hi>Miſericordia puniens.</hi> Civil Magiſtrates are ordained of God to be a <hi>terror to Evil-doers.</hi> And it is better that ſuch ſhould ſuffer, than be ſuffered to go on, to corrupt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others.</p>
            <p>It is ſinful, (againſt Charity) to will the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of another, meerly <hi>ſub ratione mali,</hi> as evil to him. But the puniſhment of notorious Offenders hath alſo <hi>Rationem boni,</hi> is good, being a means of keeping up juſtice and order, and of preſerving the community both from guilt and puniſhment. And thus the due execution of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on Evil-doers is to be willed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we deſire not their <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſo much
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:92979:109"/>as their <hi>repentance</hi> and reformation. We may will their temporal puniſhment, and yet earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that it may go well with their ſouls. And this is not inconſiſtent with true love, to will their puniſhment, but not <hi>for it ſelf</hi> as puniſhment to them, but <hi>as a means</hi> to reclaim them, to bring them to a ſenſe of their ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much of <hi>love to all</hi> Men.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) More <hi>particularly,</hi> the love of God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline a Man even to <hi>love</hi> thoſe that <hi>hate</hi> him, to love his very Enemies. <hi>Amicos dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere omnium eſt,</hi>

            <p>We may reprove an Enemy, but <hi>in love</hi> we may not <hi>reproach</hi> an Enemy.</p>
            <p>We may in many caſes <hi>defend</hi> our ſelves, yet muſt we take heed of a <hi>ſpirit of revenge,</hi> and take heed of being injurious our ſelves, under pretence of defending our ſelves from injury.</p>

                  <hi>Cor. Burgeſs.</hi> Chain of Graces. <hi>pag.</hi> 252.</note> 
               <q>He that hath not grace to love an Enemy, did never love his Friend from his heat.—Flee his friendſhip that cannot love an Enemy.—If ever thou move him, he will (be ready to) remove thee for ever from his heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now what ſay you to this: Some indeed have <hi>an Art</hi> of carrying fair and ſmooth, they can keep in their wrath that it ſhall not appear in their looks or ſpeeches. But can you truly ſay, that you love and bear an hearty good will towards others, how ill ſoever they carry towards you? Do you wiſh no worſe to them than to your own ſouls: Do you pray for them, (<hi>a kindneſs</hi> which they cannot reject,) <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgive them: Lord, lay not ſin to their charge:</hi> Would it rejoyce you to ſee them come on to a participation of Grace with you here, and ſo to have fellowſhip with you in Glory hereafter? And do you deſire their proſperity here, ſo far as may be good for them? And would you not be unwilling (if it lay in your way) to promote it? Are you ſo far from deſiring to revenge your ſelves on them, that you wait for opportunities to befriend them? Oh! how few of ſuch a ſpirit, and yet how plain a duty? <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4, 5. <hi>If thou meet thine enemies Ox or his Aſs going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again. If thou ſee the Aſs of him that hateth thee, lying under his burden, and wouldſt forbear to help him,</hi> (or wouldſt ceaſe to leave thy buſineſs
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:92979:110"/>for him) <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely help him.</hi> Rom. 12.20. <hi>If thine enemy bunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink.</hi> Mat. 7.12. <hi>All things whatſoever you would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> Not as others do to you, but as ye would that others ſhould do unto you, and that with a <hi>regular will,</hi> a will guided by a right and ſound judgment. So on the other hand, <hi>Quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri nè feceris,</hi> Do not that to another which thou wouldſt not have another do to thee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> It was ſaid of <hi>Julius Caeſar, Benignitate adeò prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus, ut quos armis ſubegerat, clementiâ magis vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> He was ſo gentle, courteous, that whom he ſubdued with <hi>force of Arms,</hi> he overcame more with <hi>clemency:</hi> and yet might he be far from lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemies, as the Word of God and the Spirit of Grace teacheth.</p>
            <p>But do you unfeignedly deſire your enemies welfare, and would you gladly be inſtruments of promoting it? Are you for <hi>doing good to them that hate you,</hi> (unleſs where it may be more to your own hurt or danger, than to their benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?)</p>
            <p>And are you ſorry, grieved for them, when <hi>evil befalleth them?</hi> Prov. 24.17. <hi>Rejoyce not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he ſtumbleth.</hi> Job 31.29, 30. <hi>If I rejoyced at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of him that hated me, or lift up my ſelf when evil found him. (Neither have I ſuffered my mouth to ſin, by wiſhing a curſe to his ſoul.)</hi> Is it no joy to you to ſee an enemy <hi>fall into miſery,</hi> much leſs a joy to ſee him <hi>fall into ſin? Charity rejoyceth not in iniquity?</hi> 1 Cor. 13.6.</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:92979:111"/>
            <p>And are you ready to take notice of any good and commendable thing in an enemy, and to <hi>ſpeak well</hi> of him for it: Have you no delight to hear or ſpeak of his faults and miſcarriages? Are you for <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> rather than <hi>diſcovering</hi> his <hi>nakedneſs?</hi> Had you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther err on the hand of Charity in making his faults leſs than they are, than make them greater? And would you not grieve ſo much for the wrong an enemy does you, as for the wrong he does his own ſoul? Would you not have ſo deep a ſenſe of the greateſt treſpaſſes againſt you, as of his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt God, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.139.) Then indeed it is to be hoped, notwithſtanding ſometimes your paſſion is too much moved on a ſuddain, yet that <hi>in cool blood</hi> you do love your Enemy.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The love of God will incline one <hi>eſpecially</hi> to <hi>love the Godly.</hi> And <hi>every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. If we love God, we cannot but love the <hi>Children of God</hi> for their Fathers ſake. There is no living Chriſtian but is a loving Chriſtian, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14.</p>
            <p>But here many deceive themſelves and others.</p>
            <p>Some only pretend love to the Godly, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe others love, and gain more eſteem of others. As <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> maintained Philoſophers, not that he did much eſteem or admire them, but becauſe he hoped to be eſteemed for them. Some love them from meer ſelf reſpects. As thoſe they have been, and further may be beholden unto, as having received kindneſs from ſuch, and being convinced of their love and good-will towards them, as having a dependance on ſuch, or being tied to them by <hi>natural bonds.</hi> They that are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>natural affection,</hi> will love their own. Some
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:92979:111"/>love them for other common worldly reſpects. As ſome of them are Men of Wiſdom and Prudence, able to adviſe in difficult and weighty matters, or learned Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt, If our love to the Godly be ſound (ſuch as will prove and evidence the love of God to be in us) then we love them <hi>for their godlineſs.</hi> Do we ſee a <hi>beauty in Holineſs?</hi> Are we ſo taken with it, that we cannot but love thoſe in whom we ſee it, cannot but highly eſteem ſuch as the <hi>excellent ones in the Earth?</hi> Do we love the Children of God, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe they are his Children, becauſe they reſemble their Father, bear his Image? As the <hi>Cynick</hi> Philoſopher could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laert.</hi> l. 6. in Diog. <hi>p.</hi> 397.</note> that <hi>good Men were images of God.</hi> Are we taken with them, for what of God, or of <hi>a divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> we ſee in them? As we are pleaſed with the <hi>Pictures</hi> of thoſe whom we love and honour. As on the contrary, if we ſhould ſee a Man expreſſing an hatred and contempt of anothers <hi>Picture,</hi> ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tearing it, ſoiling, beſpattering and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing</hi> it, we would conclude, that he hated the Perſon much more whom the Picture did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Do we love the Godly <hi>as ſuch?</hi> Mat. 10.41, 42. <hi>He that receiveth a righteous Man in the name of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man, ſhall receive a righteous Mans reward. He that gives a cup of cold Water only to a Diſciple, in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.</hi> In <hi>the name</hi> of a righteous Man, and <hi>in the name</hi> of a Diſciple, that is, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> upon that very account, and not for any lower, by-reſpects. The Apoſtle
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:92979:112"/>had a great love to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he thought on him daily, he had him daily in his beſt thoughts: and what was it that drew out his heart ſo towards him? [<hi>calling to mind</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the unfeigned faith that is in thee.</hi>] 2 Tim. 1. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Do we love the Godly for their Godlineſs in its <hi>full latitude,</hi> for the whole of it, and not for ſome parts only? We may love them <hi>in part</hi> as godly, or love <hi>ſome parts</hi> of Godlineſs, without any true love to God, and without loving them for his ſake. As many a natural Man is convinced, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Godly are better than they. As <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art more righteous than I.</hi> So ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of Godlineſs are lovely, even in the eyes of a natural Man. Plain-heartedneſs, upright-dealing in ones Calling, faithfulneſs in matters of truſt, peaceableneſs, charitableneſs, (things which <hi>Godlineſs teacheth</hi>) are commendable and amiable, even our <hi>enemies themſelves being judges.</hi> And as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs teacheth the beſt diſcharge of <hi>Relative duties,</hi> ſo far a natural Man may love it in relations. As it teacheth the <hi>Wife a chaſte converſation coupled with fear,</hi> thus a carnal Husband may love it in his Wife. As it teacheth the <hi>Child to honour his Parents,</hi> to carry reverently and dutifully towards them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Parents may ſo far like it in a Child, and love ſuch a Child the better for it. As it puts a Servant upon diligence, care and faithfulneſs in his Maſters buſineſs, that he <hi>ſerveth not with eye-ſervice, but in ſingleneſs of heart;</hi> ſo far a bad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may love a good Servant. While Godlineſs in the <hi>full latitude</hi> of it, and taking in all its <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>integral</hi> parts, is not pleaſing, but diſtaſteful unto ſuch. Where it croſſeth their corrupt <hi>Wills,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:92979:112"/>Affections,</hi> and their <hi>carnal Intereſts</hi> and Deſigns, where it reproveth and condemneth them for their ſinful omiſſions, or commiſſions; where it galleth them, they cannot away with it, or be ſo well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with others where they ſee it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And if we love the Children of God aright, for the Grace of God appearing in them, for their Godlineſs, then we <hi>love all</hi> that appear to be ſuch, we have a ſpecial love to all that are godly (ſo far as we can judge.) So the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had a <hi>love to all Saints, Col.</hi> 1.4. So <hi>Philemon, Phil.</hi> v. 5. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyneth to <hi>love the Brotherhood,</hi> (the <hi>whole Fraternity,</hi> all that were of the houſhold of Faith) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. To love <hi>all parts of Godlineſs,</hi> all Grace, (as was ſaid before) and to <hi>love all Saints,</hi> would be good evidence of the ſoundneſs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our love.</p>
            <p>But <hi>partiality</hi> here would bewray unſoundneſs, and hypocriſy. Surely that is a <hi>partial love,</hi> if we love ſome, while we deſpiſe, and lightly eſteem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who yet give as good proof of their godlineſs. Some are ready to <hi>Saint</hi> all that are of their own Party; and to <hi>un-Saint</hi> any, that differ from them, though the difference be not in any fundamental, and eſſential point of Faith, and Godlineſs, and though (perhaps) the errour, and miſtake be in themſelves. Do not ſuch love for an <hi>Opinion,</hi> or for ſome ſelf-reſpect, rather than for real Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who look but ſhily on, carry ſtrange towards any, (though ſound in all points neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſtrict and conſcientious in their lives, yea, though <hi>eminent in Godlineſs</hi>) that are not of their Opinion? Such have not learnt to love Saints, <hi>as Saints,</hi> and to love <hi>all Saints.</hi> Suppoſe ſuch as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:92979:113"/>differ from them to be but <hi>weak in the Faith,</hi> yet Chriſt would not have his <hi>little ones deſpiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And if we love the Children of God for God, and Godlineſs ſake; then the more holy, and the more like to God any are, the <hi>more</hi> we ſhall love them, and be taken with them, the more our hearts will be knit to them, (as <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Soul was <hi>knit to David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1.) And here is no reſpect of perſons, but a reſpect of goodneſs, to love them beſt, who are beſt. But if on the contrary, a Man only <hi>beareth with</hi> Holineſs in a <hi>lower degree,</hi> and with ſuch as may be Godly in the main, but very remiſs, too much complying with the manners of the World; or perhaps can afford ſuch a good word ſometimes, ſaying, ſuch are honeſt, ſober, <hi>moderate Men;</hi> when he would thereby condemn thoſe, who are more forward, when he utterly diſlikes, and his heart is riſing againſt thoſe whoſe <hi>hearts are lifted up in the ways of God;</hi> when he cannot endure ſuch as are more exactly conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and more zealous for God; when he is bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them, as <hi>Hot-ſpurs,</hi> Fanaticks, and I know not what; or if he laſh them not with the tongue, yet his heart is full of envy againſt them: what can this ſhew, but a graceleſs ſpirit? And let ſuch a one know, that the love of God is not in him. If the <hi>holineſs of a Saint</hi> be ſuch an <hi>eye-ſore</hi> to thee, for which thou canſt not affect him, how canſt thou love God, who is <hi>Holineſs it ſelf?</hi> There is none holy as the Lord, he is infinitely holy. If the light of the Moon offends thee, (which yet ſhines not without its ſpots) how canſt thou bear the ſurpaſſing brightneſs of the Sun it ſelf? And how unmeet art thou for fellowſhip with the Saints
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:92979:113"/>in Heaven, with the <hi>Spirits of Juſt Ones made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> who canſt not away with ſuch as have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any eminent degree of holineſs here? The Saints in Heaven are more holy, than any of thoſe thou thinkeſt too ſtrict, too preciſe. Perhaps thou wilt ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou couldſt love and honour them, if they were <hi>as good as they ſeem:</hi> but they are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> they do but make a ſhow. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And doſt thou indeed hate Hypocriſie? O then take heed that thou beeſt not guilty of Hypocriſie in this very plea, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou canſt not love them, becauſe they are not ſo good as they ſeem; when in very deed thou couldſt like well of them if they were worſe than they are. Again, Though it is true, Hypocrites there will be among the Saints here; yet take heed that thou doſt not cenſure, and condemn thoſe as Hypocrites, whom the Lord accepteth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth of, as ſincere and upright. Thy hard cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures cannot hurt, and prejudice them, ſo much as thy ſelf. The Devil accuſed <hi>Job</hi> to be no better than an Hypocrite. As he is called, <hi>The Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> Rev. 12.10. That this is <hi>a Diabolical Practice.</hi> And to <hi>juſtifie the Wicked,</hi> and to <hi>condemn the Righteous, are both of them an abomination to the Lord.</hi> How angry was the Lord with <hi>Job</hi>'s three friends, for their raſh cenſures of him, and harſh dealing with him? The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> (though they are abhorred of many in the World) <hi>are God's delight.</hi> And think of it, Shall not the <hi>Saints judg the World</hi> at laſt? Many that cenſure and accuſe them here, ſhall be judged, and condemded by them hereafter. Yea, their <hi>holy lives,</hi> that the World is ſo offended at, ſhall condemn the World. And thou that abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:92979:114"/>their ſtrict lives, think of it, whether (with <hi>Balaam</hi>) thou wouldeſt not deſire to dye their Death.</p>
            <p>Or 2. Perhaps thou wilt ſay, They <hi>make more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do than needs. Anſw.</hi> And wherein? Indeed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not a Chriſtian to be a <hi>buſy-body</hi> in other Mens matters. He has work enough of his own to mind. And let all that fear God, have a care to walk ſo, that others may <hi>find no occaſion againſt them, but in the matters of their God.</hi> But certainly, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. will bear them out in their greateſt Zeal, and Activity for God. So <hi>Luke.</hi> 13.24. <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight Gate,</hi> &amp;c. And Phil. 2.18. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> And 2 Pet. 2.10. <hi>Give diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure:</hi> [will warrant their moſt ſtrenuous endeavours to get to Heaven. And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly.</hi> And 1 Theſ. 5.22. <hi>Abſtain from all appearance of evil</hi>] will juſtify their tenderneſs of Spirit, and fear of Sin. And Col. 1.10. <hi>Walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitfull in every good work.</hi> And 1 Cor. 15.58. <hi>Always abounding in the work of the Lord</hi>] will prove, that the beſt are ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>more than needs,</hi> that they fall very far ſhort of doing what they ought in Religion. And therefore, as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, Mat. 26.10. <hi>Why trouble ye the Woman? for ſhe hath wrought a good work on me:</hi> So why do any go about to diſcourage ſuch, as <hi>for his Name ſake are labouring,</hi> and taking pains to glorifie God, and ſave their ſouls? Are any offended that they do ſo much? Alas, they ſee great cauſe to be aſhamed that they have done ſo little,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:92979:114"/>that they do no more for God and Jeſus Chriſt, for their own, and others ſouls! It's granted, we ſhould not be <hi>righteous over much,</hi> as we ſhould take heed of being <hi>over wiſe,</hi> (Eccleſ. 7.16.) To be <hi>wiſe above that which is written,</hi> is <hi>Wiſdom falſly ſo called:</hi> and to be <hi>righteous above that which is commanded,</hi> is but a <hi>Phariſaical righteouſneſs.</hi> That which is beyond the Rule, is not true Religion, but vain Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And works of <hi>Supererrogation,</hi> are works of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perarrogancy.</hi> But keeping to the Rule, none can be over-righteous. When it is ſaid, (there <hi>v.</hi> 17.) <hi>Be not over-much wicked</hi>] ſurely the meaning is not, that we may allow our ſelves a little here. They that would ſhun all impiety, more and leſs, are not to be condemned as <hi>over-preciſe,</hi> or doing more than needs.</p>
            <p>Or, 3. perhaps thou wilt ſay, Thou canſt not be quiet for them; they will not let thee alone, but are ſtill reproving thee. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And does that offend thee? Then, as the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>For my love they are my adverſaries;</hi> thou doſt ill requite thy beſt, thy moſt faithful friends. Then it ſeems thou loveſt thine enemies, but <hi>hateſt thy friends.</hi> And is this well done of thee? If they could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to ſuffer thee to go on offending and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking God, and wronging thine own Soul (which is not love but hatred) then thou couldſt be better pleaſed with them. If it be thus, thou neither loveſt the Godly, nor thy ſelf aright.</p>
            <p>You may think me very long on this third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Note, That if we love the Godly for God and Godlineſs-ſake, then we love them moſt who are moſt like God, moſt eminent in Godlineſs.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:92979:115"/>And yet before I paſs on to another, there is a Queſtion, or two, (that fall in here) to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Are we to love the Godly, more than near Relations, if they be not Godly: and to love thoſe, who are eminent in Godlineſs above Godly Relations, that are not ſo eminent?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a <hi>peculiar love</hi> due unto <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as ſuch, which is <hi>in part natural,</hi> and ſenſitive (as irrational Creatures alſo have a love to their mates, and a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a natural tender affection to their young) and <hi>in part</hi> alſo <hi>commanded,</hi> being a duty <hi>becoming</hi> ſuch Relations, <hi>a neceſſary Principle,</hi> and <hi>help</hi> to the diſcharge of other relative duties. To be <hi>without natural affection</hi> towards Parents, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is a great Sin, and a cauſe of other Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Relations. And if ſuch as are in a married ſtate, have not a true <hi>conjugal affection,</hi> other <hi>conjugal duties</hi> can never be rightly performed. It is certain, <hi>Grace</hi> breaketh not, but rather ſtrengthens <hi>Natures bonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So 2. We are <hi>ordinarily</hi> bound <hi>to do more</hi> for near Relations (though ungodly) than for ſtrangers, be they Godly. We are not always to do moſt for the moſt needy, and worthy; becauſe we may be <hi>under a ſpecial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty,</hi> and obligation to do for others, and we may not be able to do ſo well for both. The <hi>Law of Nature</hi> layes a ſpecial obligation on us to take ſpecial care of Wife and Children, being neareſt to us. And if we do not, who ſhould? This is a <hi>neceſſary order</hi> for the good, and preſervation of Mankind, (as that love, which is <hi>naturally</hi> planted in bruit creatures towards their young, is neceſſary for the preſervation of their kinds.) And 1 Tim. 5.8.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:92979:115"/>
               <hi>If any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. <hi>Parents ought to lay up for the Children.</hi> Parents ordinarily are bound to provide eſpecially for Children, (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo Children are bound to relieve their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and that before others. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> nouriſhed his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Famine.) Thus therefore we are eſpecially to look to thoſe whom <hi>Nature</hi> has devolved on our ſpecial care, whom God hath eſpecially committed to our charge; not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, as if we owed nothing to them, but in ſome expreſſions of love preferring thoſe to whom our obligation is greater.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet in our <hi>eſtimations</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>complacence,</hi> we are to <hi>prefer</hi> ſuch as are godly, before the neareſt Relations, if ungodly. So likewiſe muſt we prefer ſuch as are <hi>more eminent</hi> in Grace, before a godly Relation that is not ſo eminent. As Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.48, 50. <hi>Who is my Mother? and who are my brethren? Whoſoever ſhall do the will of my Father which is in Heaven, the ſame is my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Siſter, and Mother.</hi> The beſt are to be preferred in <hi>honour,</hi> though not in point of <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Then by a <hi>parity of Reaſon,</hi> are we not to love the weakeſt Chriſtian whoſe ſincerity we do not queſtion more than a Profeſſor or <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> whoſe ſincerity is very queſtionable, let their gifts be never ſo great, and let them be never ſo ſerviceable upon that account?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is certain, That <hi>gifts of edification</hi> are very deſirable and amiable, yea, they <hi>give a luſtre to Grace</hi> it ſelf. <q>As the Gold did <hi>beautify the Temple,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:92979:116"/>though the Temple did <hi>ſanctify the Gold:</hi> So (ſays one) though Grace do ſanctify Gifts, yet Gifts do beautify Grace.</q> No doubt, but Gifts to edify, to profit withal, Gifts that promote the converſion and ſalvation of others, are to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Grace is more lovely and excellent. <hi>Gifts</hi> are deſirable <hi>in ordine ad aliud,</hi> as Hand-maids to Grace: but Grace is deſirable even <hi>for it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He that is both gracious (as we cannot but judge) and alſo of eminent Gifts, is to be eſteemed above another who hath not the like Gifts, though he may have the like meaſure of ſaving Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He that hath Gifts without Grace, is to be eſteemed for that good and benefit others may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his Gifts, and ſo for the ſervice and honour God may have by them. He is to be eſteemed <hi>for others ſakes.</hi> But one that is truly godly, though his Gifts be never ſo ſmall, is to be eſteemed <hi>for his own ſake.</hi> And there is that real worth and excellency in true Grace which will <hi>weigh down</hi> the greateſt excellencies a natural Man can have.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now I proceed to another note of true love to the Godly. If we are taken with them for their godlineſs, then we are <hi>for godlineſs in our ſelves.</hi> We do not barely commend it in others, but follow after it our ſelves. We honour the Godly not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>ſpeaking well</hi> of them, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by <hi>imitating</hi> them. If we love them aright, we deſire to be like them. If we are taken with God's Image in them, we would be followers of them, ſo far as they are followers of God. And wherein we ſee our ſelves to come ſhort, we are
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:92979:116"/>aſhamed of our ſelves, and ſo far out of love with our ſelves. As the Stoicks ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laert.</hi> in Zeno. <hi>l</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 513.</note> that true friendſhip was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>inter ſolos probos, &amp; virtutis ſtudioſos,</hi> only among the good and vertuous, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whom a likeneſs (of diſpoſition and manners) uniteth. Certainly, they that care not for godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs themſelves, cannot truly love others for it. They that delight to ſee it in others, will much more deſire, and be pleaſed to find it in themſelves. To love it only <hi>at a diſtance</hi> would argue deceit in our love.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we love the Godly as ſuch, then we <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in godly ſociety.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.63. <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee,</hi> and of them that keep thy Precepts. I am for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of all ſuch, even the pooreſt, the meaneſt of them, and for no other company. <hi>All his delight</hi> was in the Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. He had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be ſo familiar and intimate with others. When we are for holy ſociety, and holy conference, it is both an <hi>expreſſion</hi> of love to the Saints, and a <hi>means to encreaſe</hi> it.</p>
            <p>But to deſpiſe a poor Saint, becauſe poor, to think ſuch unworthy of our acquaintance, to ſhun familiarity and converſe with ſuch, would ſhew a <hi>ſinful reſpect of Perſons,</hi> and partiality in our love, that we have not a love to all Saints, or to any as ſuch. So it is an <hi>ill ſign,</hi> if we are pleaſed with the ſociety of vain and <hi>vile perſons,</hi> ſuch as we ought to contemn, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4.) A Man is known what he is, by the Company he keeps, and moſt affects.</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:92979:117"/>
            <p n="6">6. Another note of true love to the Godly, is a fear of <hi>giving ſcandal,</hi> a deſire and care to walk in-offencible towards them. Yea, if we love them, it will grieve us to ſee others caſting <hi>ſtumbling-blocks</hi> in their way. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> And much more we ſhall fear to offend them our ſelves. As we would not offend and injure our friends. It is true, ſome are ſo weak that they will <hi>take offence</hi> where none is <hi>given.</hi> And we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our duty, offend God, for fear of offending or diſpleaſing our weak Brethren. Indeed this, to comply with them in their Errours and Miſtakes, and by our practice to encourage them in any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, this I ſay, would be an <hi>offence of another nature,</hi> a greater offence againſt them than to grieve them. This is <hi>real ſcandal.</hi> Like <hi>Peters</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing and ſeparating himſelf from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for fear of diſpleaſing the <hi>Jews,</hi> Gal. 2.11, 12. And yet I confeſs, when we care not <hi>unneceſſarily</hi> to grieve the ſpirits of the Godly, this is not to <hi>walk charitably.</hi> Rom. 14.15. <hi>If thy Brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably,</hi> or according to the rule of Charity. But it is a greater wrong to them (ſure) to be unneceſſarily an occaſion of their offending God, and wounding Conſcience. It is <hi>no charity</hi> to neglect duty, that we may not diſpleaſe ſome of our Brethren, when thereby we ſhould both wrong our ſelves and their ſouls too, thus allowing and encouraging them in their miſtakes.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If we love the Godly, we ſhall take well their juſt reproofs and faithful admonitions. We ſhall not be offended thereat, nor have our hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:92979:117"/>alienated and drawn from them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs.</hi>— And yet my prayer alſo ſhall be in their calamities. They that are ſo in love with their ſins, that they cannot endure any ſhould ſpeak againſt them, have little love to Holineſs. They that are offended at others zeal againſt Sin, ſhould not pretend to love them for their Holineſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Rebuke a wiſe Man, and he will love thee.</hi> None but fools would fall out with their friends, for telling them of their faults. If we love the Godly indeed, it will more endear them to us, the more experience we have of their love and faithfulneſs this way. As was obſerved of Mr. <hi>Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clark's Lives.</hi> Par. 1. p. 932.</note> He was glad when any of the <hi>Righteous ſmote him,</hi> and would take it well, not only from his Superiors, but from his Equals, and far Inferiors; and would really ſhew more teſtimonies of his love to ſuch afterwards than ever he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If we love the Godly, as we wiſh well to their ſouls, we ſhould watch over them, and be ready to admoniſh them as there is occaſion.

               <hi>Habet vera amicitia nonnunquam objurgatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem: adulationem nunquam.</hi> A <hi>ſharp rebuke</hi> is not ſo contrary to true love, as <hi>ſmooth flattery.</hi> If we love our Brethren, we muſt neither deſpiſe them for their infirmities, nor ſooth them up with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, cloke over their infirmities, but do what in us lies to cure them. As we would not <hi>hate our Brother in our heart,</hi> we muſt <hi>rebuke</hi> him, and not ſuffer ſin upon him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. And one offers
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:92979:118"/>this ſenſe of it, That if we know any fault by our Brother,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Byfield</hi> on 1 Pet. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 104.</note> and feel our ſelves tempted to an alienation from him upon that account, we muſt not ſuffer our hearts to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from him, but give them vent by a plain and diſcreet rebuke. We muſt do what we can to reform him, that we may not have our hearts withdrawn from him. When <hi>Abſalom</hi> hated <hi>Amnon,</hi> he would <hi>ſpeak to him neither good nor bad,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.22.</p>
            <p>But how many, alas, who inſtead of <hi>watching</hi> over their Brethren, to <hi>prevent their falling,</hi> and to raiſe them up when fallen, do rather <hi>watch for their halting!</hi> How many that can extenuate or make light of the foul miſcarriages of others, who love to aggravate the leaſt failings of ſerious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and are forward to ſpeak of them to others, never admoniſhing the guilty parties themſelves? Have ſuch any true love to them? Are they not <hi>falſe Brethren?</hi> That in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer ſin upon him:</hi> Some ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pools Synopſis Criticorum.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Non elevabis ſuper eum peccatum:</hi> Thou ſhalt not lift or hold up ſin upon him. And give this ſenſe, Thou ſhalt <hi>rebuke privately,</hi> not openly. As <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Tell him his fault between thee and him alone.</hi> And ſo it is <hi>covered,</hi> (as it were:) but when it is proclaimed abroad, then it is (as it were) held up over him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If we truly love the Godly, than we really <hi>ſympathize</hi> with them. We ſhall be like thoſe <hi>Twins,</hi> that uſed to laugh, and weep together. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of ſuch will be our joy; and their adverſity
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:92979:118"/>and ſufferings, our grief and ſorrow. As it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.10. <hi>Rejoyce ye with Jeruſalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her.</hi> As, if <hi>one member be honoured, all the members will rejoyce with it,</hi> 1 Cor 12.26. So, on the other hand, if <hi>one member ſuffers,</hi> all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſuffer with it. Now, do we <hi>rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep?</hi> As Job 30.25. Did <hi>not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my Soul grieved for the poor?</hi> Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſhewed his love to God's People when (hearing that the <hi>remnant of the captivity were in great affliction and reproach,)</hi> he <hi>mourned, and wept, and faſted, and prayed,</hi> Neh. 1.3, 4. He could not but <hi>look ſad</hi> upon it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1, 2. The believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> were <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with them that ſuffered,</hi> Heb. 10.33. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, were partakers, had afflictions <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with them, were grieved for others troubles, as if they had been their own, (or more then if they had been their own, for we read in the next verſe, <hi>they took joyfully the ſpoiling of their own goods.</hi>) So they <hi>had compaſſion on the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>in his bonds,</hi> ver. 34. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ye ſympathized</hi> as if ye had been fellow-ſufferers with me.</p>
            <p>So, if indeed we love the Godly <hi>(a friend loveth at all times)</hi> we ſhall love them, when they are moſt hated of the World; we ſhall honour them, when moſt contemned, and trampled on; we ſhall be pittiful, and have our bowels troubled for them, when others may ſhew themſelves harſh, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, full of ſpite againſt them. The Trials of the Faithful will be ſo far from cooling, and abating our love, (if it be ſincere) that rather they will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a drawing of it out more. If we are only <hi>ſummer-Friends,</hi> our love is nothing-worth.</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:92979:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="10">10. If we love the Godly, we ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own them, when under reproach and ſufferings. When they are <hi>black with lying among the Pots,</hi> we ſhall not therefore turn away our faces from them. As <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> ſhewed his love to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.16, 17. <hi>He was not aſhamed of my Chain,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>But when he was in</hi> Rome, <hi>he ſought me out very diligently, and found me.</hi> As <hi>Vegetius Epagathus</hi> was called <hi>The Advocate of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euſeb. Eccleſiaſt. Hiſt. lib. 5. cap. 1.</note> We ſhall be ready to vindicate, and plead for them, when ſlandered, reproached, and unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of others. To be like the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that would claim kindred with the <hi>Jews</hi> while they were in a flouriſhing and proſperous eſtate; but would diſown them when at an under. To ſeem to be on their ſide, while they are countenanced and favoured; but to forſake them when the World frowns on them, would argue our love unſound. To love them but <hi>in ſubordination</hi> to our reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World, and to our carnal intereſts, is not to love them ſincerely. <hi>Moſes choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin for a ſeaſon. And eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Aegypt,</hi> Heb. 11.25, 26. So love to the Godly, and to their ſociety would make us willing to ſhip our ſelves in the ſame bottom; to take our lot with them in ſufferings, rather than forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together with them.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If we love the Godly, than we ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to relieve them. As we are required to <hi>do good unto all Men</hi> (as we have opportunity) but <hi>eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:92979:119"/>to thoſe that are of the houſhold of Faith,</hi> Gal. 6.10. We ſhall not <hi>love in word, or in tongue only, but in deed and in truth.</hi> But <hi>whoſo hath this Worlds good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeeth his Brother have need, and yet ſhutteth up his Bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God</hi> (or of his Brother) <hi>in him?</hi> 1 John 3.17. As one ſays of true Friends, they will not come in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity when called, but they will come in adverſity uncalled. Like that ſaying of <hi>Chilo,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ib. in <hi>Zeno.</hi> l. 7. 513.</note> As the Stoicks ſaid, Among Friends there is a certain community of thoſe things, which are neceſſary to life, we uſing our Friends as our ſelves. As we read of the <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtans,</hi> Act. 4.32. <hi>Neither ſaid any of them, that ought of the things that he poſſeſſed, was his own, but they had all things common.</hi> Then a <hi>community of goods</hi> was very needful and expedient, when ſo many from remote parts came to joyn themſelves with the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But inſtead of that community, afterwards Chriſtians were required to be <hi>ready to diſtribute, and willing to communicate,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.18. And to the end they might be more ready and free this way, the Apoſtle ordered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. that <hi>every one ſhould lay by him in ſtore</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing every week, <hi>as God had proſpered him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And true love would not be ſatisfied, in our giving a few good words to our Brethren, and fellow-Chriſtians in neceſſity, and diſtreſs, as ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Depart in peace, be warmed, be filled,</hi> (Jam. 2.16.) but it would cauſe us to <hi>abound in good works.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of their <hi>work, and labour of love,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:92979:120"/>ſhewed to God's Name, in miniſtring to his Saints,</hi> Heb. 6.10. And thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would prove the <hi>genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineneſs,</hi> and ſincerity of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> love, 2 Cor. 8.8. If we would prove that our love is not adulterate, or ſpurious; but right indeed, we muſt be free, and forward this way, in miniſtring to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Saints, and that <hi>for the Lords ſake.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly while we grudg them any part of our Eſtates, they have little ſhare in our hearts;

            <p>This is certainly the Creatures duty: yea, ſo great a duty, that it is oft put for the <hi>whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>

And 10.20. <hi>[Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God,]</hi> which we read thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God.</hi> And the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is uſed for <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Reverence,</hi> and for <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> too. And as we are required to <hi>ſerve the Lord in fear,</hi> Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. So we cannot <hi>ſerve</hi> him <hi>acceptably without it.</hi> Heb. 12.28. <hi>Let us have Grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with Reverence and godly Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is a great duty, ſo it is our ſafety and ſecurity. <hi>In the Fear of the Lord is ſtrong confidence.</hi> The more we fear God, the leſs we need to fear Creatures, Men, or Devils. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the ſnares of death.</hi> The Fear of the Lord is <hi>a treaſure.</hi> And he <hi>that hath it ſhall abide ſatisfied.</hi> He <hi>ſhall not be viſited with evil.</hi> There is <hi>no want to them that fear him.</hi> And no evil ſhall befal them. <hi>Surely it ſhall be well with them that fear God. Bleſſed is the Man that feareth the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Fear</hi> is oft put for the <hi>whole condition</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> as the word <hi>Faith</hi> is oft uſed in the <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I come to the trial of our <hi>Fear,</hi> there is an Objection or two to be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Is it not Man's greateſt and higheſt duty to love God? and can we both <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> him? Does not the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſay, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſteth out fear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) It muſt be noted, that we are oft expreſsly required in the Word, both to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> the Lord; therefore certainly they are not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:92979:122"/>
               <hi>oppoſites.</hi> That one Text is ſufficient to prove that they well agree, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. <hi>And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him.</hi> Yea, take this along with you, if we do not <hi>love God above all,</hi> and <hi>fear him above all,</hi> he is not <hi>our God.</hi> Iſa. 8.13. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That Text of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> many underſtand of the <hi>love of God</hi> to us,
<note place="margin">Calvin. Heming. Danae.</note> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us, expelling <hi>fear,</hi> that is <hi>fear of the day of judgment,</hi> of condemnation. As he had ſaid in the verſe foregoing, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>In this love is, or hath been perfected with us, that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment.</hi> If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the faithful are not yet without all fear in this reſpect: It is anſwered, <hi>Metus verè pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur; quia fidei locum cedit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fear</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>caſt out,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>giving ground</hi> to Faith. And though it may <hi>diſquiet,</hi> it does not <hi>confound</hi> us. It is not prevalent, as before. Here conſult <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Yet I confeſs, I am not ſo well ſatisfied with that ſenſe which ſeems to be forced, and does not ſo well agree with what follows, <hi>[He that feareth, is not made perfect in love.]</hi> Therefore underſtanding the Apoſtle to ſpeak of <hi>our love,</hi> (as other good Expoſitors take the words, and ſeems to be the plain ſenſe) yet we are to <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of love,</hi> and alſo <hi>of fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love may be ſaid to be <hi>perfect,</hi> either <hi>for kinds,</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:92979:122"/>or <hi>for degrees.</hi> It may be called pefect love,
<note place="margin">Beza. Danae. Eſti Piſcat.</note> when it is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſincere,</hi> and not only when it is <hi>conſummate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Fear</hi> is manifold, and of divers kinds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>Natural fear,</hi> which is a <hi>paſſion of the ſoul</hi> implanted by God, whereby we naturally abhor and flee from what is deſtructive, or grievous and hurtful to our natures. This in it ſelf is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil</hi> in a <hi>moral ſenſe.</hi> It is not <hi>morally good,</hi> for it is alſo found in Brutes, in irrational Creatures, that are not capable of <hi>moral goodneſs.</hi> Neither is it <hi>morally evil.</hi> For God is the Author of it, as of our Natures; but he is not the <hi>Author of Sin</hi> or <hi>moral evil.</hi> Even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf taking Mans Nature on him, was not <hi>made without fear,</hi> Mar. 14.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. But this pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fear is good <hi>Phyſically,</hi> it is greatly uſeful, and very neceſſary for the Creatures preſervation. It is <hi>a guard</hi> to our lives, a means to keep us off from rocks of danger. Which is the ground of the Latine Proverb, <hi>Timidi Mater non flet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Carnal fear.</hi> Fear <hi>out of its wits.</hi> The <hi>exceſs</hi> of natural fear. Such a fear as we read of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. <hi>The fear of Man bringeth a ſnare,</hi> which is there oppoſed to <hi>truſt in the Lord.</hi> An undue, or exceſſive fear of Creatures or outward evils. A fearing <hi>where no fear is,</hi> a fearing <hi>without juſt ground;</hi> or a fearing Creatures more than they are to be feared, a fearing <hi>without due bounds.</hi> We may fear Men as the <hi>rod of God's anger,</hi> but we muſt fear God more. He holds the rod in his hand, and it is not to be feared but with reſpect to him that holds it, that hath the command and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:92979:123"/>diſpoſe of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. Though Chriſt, as he was Man, had a <hi>natural reluctancy</hi> to ſuffering, yet he had no baſe carnal fear upon him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.11. To <hi>Pilate</hi> boaſting of his power, [<hi>Knoweſt thou not that I have power to crucify thee,</hi> &amp;c.] He anſwereth <hi>[Thou couldſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.]</hi> Carnal fear is not from meer nature, but from the <hi>corruption of nature,</hi> and is <hi>ſinful in it ſelf, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing too much</hi> to Creatures, and detracting, <hi>derogating</hi> from the power, dominion, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling providence of God; and is further a <hi>cauſe of much ſin,</hi> as we may ſee in <hi>Peter,</hi> when through this Fear he denied his Lord and Maſter. It is a great <hi>impediment</hi> to Grace, an hindrance of Duty, it quite <hi>unbingeth</hi> and ſadly diſtracteth the Mind and Spirit where it prevails.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>ſervile</hi> or ſlaviſh Fear. <hi>Timor poenae, non culpae.</hi> A fear of puniſhment only, not of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending; or a fear to offend, <hi>only with reſpect</hi> to the puniſhment. This is the <hi>property of Slaves.</hi> It's true, the wrath and ſword of the Civil Magiſtrate is to <hi>be feared,</hi> Rom. 13.4. Then much more are we to fear the Wrath of God, his Judgments. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> But this is far ſhort of the duty of Fear that we owe to God. He is not only to be feared in this reſpect. Nay, this Fear is no further good than it leads unto, and helps forward an holy, <hi>filial Fear of God.</hi> As the <hi>Needle</hi> draws the <hi>Thread</hi> after it (as <hi>Auſtine</hi> has the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.) But as a <hi>Natural fear</hi> agrees to all Men, a meer <hi>ſervile fear</hi> is proper to wicked Men. And yet we cannot blame them for fearing ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:92979:123"/>Judge and incenſed Majeſty, or trembling at ſuch puniſhment as <hi>Hell-torments:</hi> but that their <hi>fear</hi> of God is <hi>ſeparated</hi> from all <hi>true love</hi> to God, and that notwithſtanding their <hi>fear of puniſhment</hi> they have ſtill <hi>a love to</hi> their ſins, that it is a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them to think of being reſtrained from them. Without doubt, the wicked and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent are bound to believe God's threatnings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſuch in his holy Word, and ſo to conclude themſelves at preſent in a miſerable ſtate, ſubject to God's wrath and curſe, and final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that if they die in their preſent ſtate, they are ſure to be damned. And certainly, they that are bound to believe and conclude thus of themſelves, ought thereupon to be <hi>moved with fear.</hi> Can there be any greater <hi>fool-hardineſs</hi> than this, for any to ſee <hi>Hell before them,</hi> to ſee themſelves ready to drop into that <hi>Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone</hi> for ever, and yet not <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>tremble?</hi> only indeed ſuch are not to deſpair, to conclude <hi>there is no hope.</hi> There is hope yet upon condition, and ſuppoſition, that if they repent and turn, they ſhall live, they ſhall not die.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>penal Fear,</hi> not only a fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but a fear inflicted <hi>as a puniſhment.</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and <hi>conſternation of mind</hi> is threatned as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, Lev. 26.16. <hi>I alſo will do this unto you, I will even appoint over you terrour.</hi> And v. 36. and if Men ſin <hi>ſin wilfully after</hi> they had <hi>received the knowledg of the truth, there remains nothing</hi> for them, <hi>but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries,</hi> Heb. 10.27. This <hi>penal fear</hi> in its <hi>full ſtrength</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is upon the Devils, and the Spirits of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:92979:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>ones <hi>in Priſon</hi> with them. They cannot but tremble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. Horrour hath taken full and faſt hold of them, which they can no more any ways ſhake off. This is one part of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and miſery of the Damned, that they can never think of God, and of his Wrath, without Horrour: and while they lie under the fierceneſs of his Wrath, while they feel the weight and heat of it, while they are <hi>ſcorching in the flames</hi> of his Wrath, how is it poſſible to put off ſuch thoughts?</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is alſo a gracious, <hi>holy, filial Fear.</hi> A <hi>Godly Fear,</hi> and a Fear proper to the Godly. Which is not only a fear of God <hi>as a Judg,</hi> but <hi>as a Father;</hi> not only a fear of Puniſhment, but of the Offence, a fear proceeding from Love. An humble and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpect to his Preſence, Majeſty, and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; a careful ſhunning of what we know to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him; not only in regard of his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Power, Holineſs, Juſtice, but alſo in regard of his Goodneſs and Mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.4. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. There is a <hi>Natural</hi> Fear, (as we have heard:) but this is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Fear. A Grace, a choice fruit of the Sanctifying Spirit, who is therefore called the <hi>Spirit of Fear,</hi> Iſa. 11.2. There is a <hi>Sinful</hi> Fear, which is forbidden (as the Fear of Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but this is a great <hi>Duty</hi> commanded. A ſpecial means to keep from ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.20. There is a <hi>Servile</hi> Fear: but this is a <hi>Fear of Sons,</hi> not of Slaves; it well agrees with the Spirit of Adoption. There is a <hi>Penal</hi> Fear: but this is no Puniſhment, but a ſpecial <hi>Bleſſing;</hi> a rare and excellent gift of God. As that is a precious Promiſe, Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my Fear in their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhall apply theſe things to the Text ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:92979:124"/>in theſe following Concluſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not to be expected that the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love found in any Saint upon Earth, ſhould quite expel and <hi>caſt out</hi> all <hi>natural Fear.</hi> Chriſt's Love was abſolutely perfect; yet was he not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>natural</hi> fear of Death; only that <hi>natural paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> was in a perfect ſubjection to his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> (the <hi>higher powers</hi> of his Soul) and theſe in perfect ſubjection to the will of God his Father. Note, it is the work of Grace here, not to <hi>extirpate natural</hi> Paſſions, but to rule and govern them. And the Self-denial, Faith, Love, Patience, Conſtancy of the Saints, would not be tried by their ſufferings, if theſe were things that they had no fear of, no natural reluctancy unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So far as <hi>the love</hi> of God <hi>prevails,</hi> ſo far <hi>carnal</hi> fear is <hi>expelled.</hi> And ſome very learned Men think,
<note place="margin">Quem timorem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligi praeſtat, niſi negation is auctorem? quam dilectionem perfectam adfirmat, niſi fugatricem ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris &amp; animatricem confeſſionis? <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull. adverſ. Gnostic.</hi>
               </note> the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of this kind of fear. So <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi> As the <hi>Fearful,</hi> that are joyned with the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving,</hi> Rev. 21.8. may well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of ſuch, as are <hi>overpowr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with carnal</hi> fear. Such as are <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed</hi> with that <hi>ſpirit of fear,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. of ſuch a baſe, cowardly, timerous ſpirit, that they dare not own the truth, and ways of God, when any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may attend it. Much might be ſaid for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. It cannot well be denied, but carnal fear is a <hi>tormenting</hi> thing. But ſuch is the <hi>power of holy love,</hi> that it will raiſe the Soul ordinarily above ſuch fear. It will endue a Chriſtian with a <hi>ſpirit of fortitude,</hi> to bear the greateſt torments Men can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:92979:125"/>as was ſeen in the Martyrs. But as love in the Saints is not <hi>abſolutely</hi> perfect here; ſo neither are they wholly freed here from carnal fear: nor are they wholly under the power of it. It riſeth ſometimes, and puts them into great diſorder, and confuſion for a time, but it is quelled, and ſuppreſſed again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the <hi>love</hi> of God <hi>gets ground</hi> in the heart, <hi>ſervile</hi> fear is giving place. The more vigorous and lively our love to God is, the clearer evidence we have of his love to us, that ordinarily we ſhall be more freed from that <hi>tormenting fear,</hi> of being under his wrath. And while we <hi>act from love,</hi> it is certain, we are not only or chiefly <hi>irrepelled by fear.</hi> If love to God, and his ſervice be the <hi>chief moving principle,</hi> then fear of puniſhment is not the chief. And further, the more we love God, the more unwilling we ſhall be to entertain hard, and black thoughts of him. The more we love him, the more lovely he appears to us. And while our hearts are united, and cleave to him in love, we are ſecured from that fear, which drives Souls from him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A true <hi>filial Fear</hi> of God is ſo far from being contrary to, that it is a <hi>good evidence</hi> of love to God. As on the contrary, if we do not ſtand in awe of him, if we care not to offend, and diſpleaſe him, it is an <hi>argument</hi> that we do not love him. True love to God will make us tender of his Honour, and moſt ſollicitous to keep in his Favour. <hi>(Res eſt ſolliciti plena timoris amor.)</hi> Thus if we have the Love of God in us, we ſhall fear, and ſhun what we know to be diſpleaſing, and a diſhonour to him. And when we <hi>fear ſin,</hi> more than <hi>puniſhment,</hi> it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:92979:125"/>argues, that we love God <hi>above our ſelves;</hi> that his Honour is dearer to us, than our own eaſe, or intereſt.</p>
            <p>Yet all <hi>fear of puniſhment</hi> is not contrary to the <hi>love</hi> of God, nor will prove one of a <hi>ſlaviſh ſpirit.</hi> A Child of God is to fear diſinheriting, and an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſeparation from God, <hi>upon ſuppoſition</hi> of apoſtacy, and falling off from God. And this fear of Hell and Condemnation <hi>upon ſuppoſition</hi> if he ſhould fall away, is <hi>a means</hi> to keep him in the love of God. Such a fear is no enemy to Grace, but very much befriends it, is a <hi>preſervative</hi> of Grace.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe a Child of God may, and ought to fear Divine chaſtiſements. And ſuch a fear Faith will work. As a ſound Faith gives credit to the <hi>whole Word</hi> of God, to <hi>Threatnings,</hi> as well as <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> And ſee concerning this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32. with a multitude of other texts. And ſuch a fear tendeth to promote <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and ſpiritual <hi>Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And we have need to make uſe of <hi>all means</hi> and Arguments, that the Lord hath given, and thought meet for our quickning. And indeed when afflictions would not be ſo greatly dreaded, (though grievous to ſenſe) but as they are <hi>expreſſions</hi> of God's fatherly <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> ſurely this is <hi>Child-like.</hi> Would it not argue, that the Child has a loving, and <hi>duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſpect</hi> to his Father, when he could better bear the <hi>ſmart of the Rod,</hi> than his Fathers <hi>angry looks</hi> in laying it on? It's true, a fear of puniſhment, and ſuffering <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly,</hi> is the <hi>note of a ſlave.</hi> Yet an ingenuous Child will fear the Rod too. But there is this difference, a ſlave fears his Maſters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure <hi>chiefly,</hi> becauſe he is like to ſmart for it, and to ſuffer by it; whereas a loving Child fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:92979:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Rod</hi> moſt, as it <hi>declares</hi> his Fathers diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p n="5">5. An holy <hi>reverential,</hi> admiring and adoring Fear, being moved and ſutably affected with God's tranſcendent Greatneſs, and infinite Excellencies, is never <hi>caſt out,</hi> but continues when love is made perfect in Heaven. This part of filial Fear well becomes Angels and Saints in Heaven. How do they for ever <hi>reverence,</hi> and adore him! To this fear of reverence we may apply that expreſſion of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Fear of the Lord is elean, enduring for ever.</hi> There is no <hi>penal</hi> Fear in Heaven, no Fear, that has any <hi>torment</hi> in it, there is no fear of God's anger, or of Gods hiding his face any more; yet when love is perfected, an holy <hi>reverential</hi> fear ſhall be perfected together with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Fear is of ſome <hi>evill:</hi> but God is the <hi>cheifeſt Good;</hi> and therefore no <hi>proper object</hi> of fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. As <hi>Moraliſts</hi> ſpeak of Fear, it is <hi>of evil,</hi> and evil <hi>to come;</hi> (for if the evil be <hi>preſent,</hi> then not the paſſion of <hi>fear,</hi> but <hi>ſorrow</hi> is exerciſed about it.) But though thus God be not <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> the <hi>object</hi> of Fear, he is the object of Fear <hi>indirectly,</hi> as one that may inflict evil, yea, greater evil than others can. So we ſhould <hi>fear him, who is able to deſtroy both Body, and Soul in Hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. yea, as he is the <hi>cheifeſt Good,</hi> we ſhould <hi>fear the loſs</hi> of him, as the <hi>greateſt evil.</hi> Thus we ſhould <hi>fear the Lord, and his Goodneſs,</hi> (Hoſ. 3.5.) That he is <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf,</hi> infinitely good, it is beſt for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, it is the Creatures higheſt felicity to be united to him, and admitted to a bleſſed fruition of him: and <hi>conſequently</hi> it is the greateſt miſery, to loſe the favour and fruition of God. The loſs of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:92979:126"/>
               <hi>infinite Goodneſs,</hi> is certainly the <hi>greateſt loſs,</hi> that ever befell us. What we love, and prize, we fear to loſe. As we love our lives, and therefore <hi>fear Death.</hi> Thus if God ought to be loved above all, as the <hi>chiefeſt Good;</hi> the <hi>loſs</hi> of him is to be feared above all loſſes, as the <hi>greateſt evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Grace</hi> of Fear is a more free, ingenuous thing, than the <hi>paſſion</hi> of Fear. The Grace of Fear includes <hi>reverence,</hi> as hath been ſaid. And that which excites <hi>reverence</hi> is an apprehenſion of God's infinite <hi>Excellencies,</hi> and his ſoveraign <hi>Authority:</hi> Job. 13.11. <hi>Shall not his Excellency</hi> make you afraid? Job. 25.2. <hi>Dominion and Fear are with him.</hi> For his Majeſty, and Dominion he is to be feared. God is to be feared, as infinitely <hi>above us,</hi> though we ſhould not apprehend him to be <hi>againſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to the Queſtion,</p>
            <p>How the true Fear of God may be known?</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the <hi>ground</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The true fear of God ariſeth from a <hi>ſound Knowledg</hi> of God. <hi>Spiritual Knowledg</hi> (as I have ſhewed before) is the <hi>ground-work</hi> of all ſaving Grace. And they that know not God aright, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fear God aright. <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.33. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdom. Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremel.</hi> read it thus, <hi>anteit reverentiam Jehovae eruditio ſapientiae,</hi> The inſtruction of wiſdom goes before the fear of the Lord. So <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed, 1 King. 8.43.—<hi>That all the people of the Earth may know thy Name, to fear thee.</hi>—</p>
            <p>So there muſt be a <hi>Knowledg</hi> of God in his <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes.</hi> The Name of God is dreadful, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58. That thou mayeſt <hi>fear this glorious,</hi> and <hi>fearful Name, the Lord thy God.</hi> He is to be feared for his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:92979:127"/>abſolute <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> Mal. 1.14. <hi>I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and my Name is dreadful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, Jer. 10.7. <hi>Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations? for to thee doth it appertain.</hi> For his Immenſity. That he fills Heaven and Earth with his Preſence; and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him. Surely the Lord <hi>moſt high is terrible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his Almighty Power, <hi>None can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> Thoſe that walk in Pride (how high ſoever) he is able to abaſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35, 37. And ſhould we not <hi>fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell?</hi> Luk. 12.5. For his Omniſcience, That <hi>all things are naked and open unto his eyes with whom we have to do.</hi> For his Infinite Holineſs and Purity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord? for thou only art holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his glorious Juſtice, <hi>Job</hi> 37.23, 24. <hi>Men do therefore him fear.</hi> Yea, for his abundant goodneſs and rich Mercy. As in thoſe Texts fore-cited, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. Should we not fear to offend, and diſpleaſe ſo good and gracious a God!</p>
            <p>Here take notice, the fear of the moſt is from very ſhort and <hi>inadequate conceptions,</hi> and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God. One while they conceit him to be made up <hi>all of Mercy,</hi> and then they <hi>fear</hi> him <hi>not at all,</hi> but only preſume on his Goodneſs. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while they conceit him to be made up <hi>all of Juſtice</hi> and ſeverity, and then they can do nothing but fear; then they <hi>meditate</hi> nothing but <hi>terrour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, The <hi>Relations</hi> God ſtands in towards us his Creatures, are a ground of his fear. He is our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter, Mal.</hi> 1.6. Our <hi>Father.</hi> Mal.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:92979:127"/>2.10. <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</hi> And they that are not come to own him as their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> and ſee their whole dependance on him as their Father, cannot fear him aright.</p>
            <p>Further, The <hi>Works of God</hi> are a ground of his fear. The work of <hi>Creation,</hi> Pſal. 33.8, 9. Works of <hi>Providence,</hi> Jer. 5.22. particularly, works of <hi>Judgment.</hi> Thus God is oft <hi>terrible in his doings towards the Children of Men,</hi> Pſal. 66.3, 5. <hi>Moſes</hi> was afraid of the hot diſpleaſure wherewith the Lord was wroth againſt the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 9.19. And when <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> was ſmitten, <hi>David was afraid of the Lord that day,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.9. If the righteous are ſaid <hi>not to fear</hi> at ſuch times, as <hi>Job</hi> 5.21, 22. we muſt underſtand, with ſuch a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>diſtracting fear</hi> as is wont to poſſeſs the hearts of ſinners. They are not ſo <hi>ſurrounded</hi> with <hi>fear,</hi> like <hi>Paſhur,</hi> called <hi>Magor-miſſabib,</hi> Jer. 20.3. Their fear is not overwhelming, or ſuch as is <hi>oppoſite</hi> to all <hi>Faith,</hi> Hope, and joy in the Lord, or ſuch as puts them quite beſides their duty at ſuch times. Yet they may not be ſtupid, ſenſleſs, but ought to fear with ſuch a <hi>fear,</hi> as is <hi>oppoſite</hi> to <hi>ſecurity,</hi> as may quicken unto Duty. <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.16. A <hi>wiſe Man feareth, and departeth from evil.</hi> Pro. 22.3. <hi>He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth the evil, and hideth himſelf.</hi> Yea, not only God's Judgments, but his Works of <hi>Mercy</hi> ſhould teach us to fear him. So much is implied, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.24. As they ſhould have ſaid in their heart, <hi>Let us now fear the Lord our God that giveth Rain, both the former, and the latter rain in his ſeaſon; he reſerveth unto us the appointed weeks of the Harveſt.</hi> And while tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mercies ſhould have this effect, to engage us to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:92979:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>fear him; much more ſhould ſpiritual Mercies, and his Grace in Chriſt. That there is forgiveneſs with him.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Word of God</hi> teacheth his Fear. As <hi>Faith</hi> comes <hi>by the Word of God</hi> (which is therefore fitly called, <hi>The word of Faith</hi>) ſo a <hi>Godly fear.</hi> As the Word is called by that name. It is called, <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 19.9. It <hi>teacheth</hi> his fear, it is a ſpecial <hi>means</hi> to work his fear in us, it is the <hi>Rule</hi> to guide, and order our fear of him. And that is a ſuperſtitious fear, a ſpurious fear, not a true <hi>genuine</hi> fear of God, which is not agreeable to his Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. Therefore ſuch as regard not the Word, but count it as <hi>a ſtrange thing,</hi> are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Fear of God. As it ſhews, we fear not God, as we ought, if we ſlight and contemn his <hi>Works;</hi> ſo if we ſlight, and diſregard his <hi>Word.</hi> It is by the <hi>knowledg of God,</hi> his Attributes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as revealed in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> that Men come to fear him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true Fear of God alſo ſprings from an high and <hi>holy admiration</hi> of him, and from love to him. Every Child of God, admires, loves, and fears together. And becauſe he loves God, he fears to diſpleaſe him. And his fear is from <hi>high thoughts</hi> of God, not from <hi>hard thoughts</hi> of him. Many have a fear of God, that do not reverence him. Their fear is not from any high eſteem of him. The wicked <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>hate. His terrours make them afraid,</hi> (as it is, <hi>Job.</hi> 18.11.) but they are not taken with his <hi>Excellency.</hi> The Devils have ſuch a fear; They <hi>tremble</hi> at his Wrath; yet are full of rage, and ſpite againſt him. That fear which is from hard thoughts of God, looking on him as an enemy, is not a right fear.</p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:92979:128"/>
            <p n="2">(2.) The true Fear of God may be known by the <hi>freeneſs,</hi> and <hi>pleaſingneſs</hi> of it. When it is not a forced thing. When the will is to fear him. A fear of God <hi>falleth</hi> upon ſome, even as an <hi>heavy preſſure,</hi> which they would be rid of, would caſt off, if they knew how. It <hi>ſurprizeth,</hi> takes hold of them, as a Bailiff, or Officer takes hold on a Debtor, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14.) which they would ſhake off, but cannot. But they do not <hi>chuſe the Fear of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 1.29. whereas they that truly fear God, are <hi>devoted to his Fear,</hi> as we read that, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.38. They <hi>deſire to fear his Name.</hi> As Neh. 1.11.—<hi>thy Servants who deſire to fear thy Name.</hi> God's Servants do fear, and deſire more and more to fear his Name. They would not baniſh, but endeavour to cheriſh, and increaſe the fear of God in their hearts. That fear, which is a <hi>torment,</hi> which is counted a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Men would expel, is not of the right kind. True Fear is not an oppreſſion of ſpirit, but rather elevates the Spirit, it raiſeth the Soul in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; does not ſink it in dejection. As we may allude to that expreſſion, Iſa. 60.5. <hi>Thine heart ſhall fear, and be inlarged.</hi>—The true Fear of God will enlarge the heart more towards God. It will cauſe it to flow over. The Grace of Fear does not contract, but enlarge the heart. <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the moſt <hi>fearful</hi> creatures have the <hi>largeſt hearts.</hi> And the more we fear God aright, the more our hearts will be enlarged towards him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The true Fear of God may be known by the <hi>degree,</hi> and meaſure, or <hi>intention</hi> of it. When we fear God above all. He is <hi>greatly to be feared,</hi> 1 Chr. 16.25. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he alſo is to be <hi>feared above all Gods.</hi> To be
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:92979:129"/>feared above all Creatures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. Who art thou, <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a Man</hi> that ſhall die, and of the Son of Man which ſhall be made as the Graſs! And <hi>forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker</hi>—and haſt feared continually every day, becauſe of the fury of the oppreſſor? ſee again <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah <hi>feared the Lord greatly,</hi> 1 Kin. 18.3. As Fear is <hi>part of the worſhip</hi> which is required in the <hi>firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> God is ſo to be feared, as we are not to fear any other. If we fear any other (perſon or thing) <hi>above him,</hi> or like, and <hi>equally</hi> to him, then we <hi>ſet up other Gods</hi> beſides him. What we fear moſt, that is our God.</p>
            <p>Now how is it with us? Does the fear of God <hi>rule</hi> in our hearts? Does it ordinarily <hi>prevail</hi> over carnal fear? when the Lord threatneth on one hand, and Men threaten on the other, which of theſe do we ordinarily moſt regard? Are we more afraid of God's diſpleaſure, of his frowns, than of the wrath of Man, than of the frowns of the World; when it comes to a pinch at any time, that we muſt either ſuffer for ſin, if we chuſe to ſin, that is, to incur God's diſpleaſure, rather than ſuffer, rather than bear Man's diſpleaſure; is not this to fear Man, more than God? In this caſe may not the Lord ſay of us, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.11. <hi>Of whom haſt thou been afraid, or feared,</hi> that thou haſt lied, and <hi>haſt not remembred me?</hi> So when Children, or Servants, make nothing of the ſin of lying, to hide any fault, and by this means to prevent their Parents, or Maſters diſpleaſure; does it not ſhew that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God, that they do not fear him? The true fear of God would check carnal fear. Though carnal fear be not <hi>totally expelled</hi> here; yet the grace of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:92979:129"/>fear will <hi>keep it under.</hi> I grant, that a Child of God may be foiled, and worſted on a ſuddain, and for a time by carnal fear. As <hi>Peter</hi> was once, and again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.69. <hi>&amp;c. Gal.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>Now if you ask, Can ſuch a one fear God <hi>above all,</hi> in whom carnal fear at any time prevailes? The Anſwer is, He may have the <hi>habit,</hi> though the <hi>act</hi> for the preſent be ſuſpended. No Grace here is perfect. And as our <hi>love</hi> to God ſometimes <hi>lies buried</hi> (as it were) under carnal ſelf-love, and inordinate love to creatures, yet ſo as it will have a <hi>reſurrection</hi> and new quickning, if it be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. ſound and ſincere: ſo our fear of God, being imperfect, may for a time be born down with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fear, yet will it get the upper hand again. The true fear of God overcomes <hi>ordinarily,</hi> in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with carnal fear; and though it may be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground ſometimes, it ſhall <hi>overcome at laſt.</hi> As ſome of the Martyrs, upon the firſt onſet ſeemed to turn back: but they came on again, and ſo ſtood ſtoutly to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The true fear of God may be known by the <hi>effects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) One principal effect of the Fear of God is a <hi>flight from ſin.</hi> I ſay it will cauſe us to flee from ſin. As we read of <hi>Job.</hi> chap. 1.1. that he was <hi>one that feared God, and eſchewed evil.</hi> And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 5.15. <hi>ſo did not I,</hi> (he did not, durſt not do, as others had done before him) becauſe <hi>of the Fear of God.</hi> Pro. 16.6. <hi>By the Fear of the Lord, Men depart from evil.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 36.1. The <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no Fear of God before their eyes.</hi> Though the wicked will not ſay ſo much with his lips, yet indeed his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:92979:130"/>
               <hi>Life</hi> proclaims it. Though the Pſalmiſt did not hear it in <hi>his words;</hi> yet his <hi>works</hi> forced him to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</hi> that there was <hi>no Fear of God before his eyes.</hi> They <hi>that forſake the Lord,</hi> thereby ſhew, that <hi>his Fear is not in them,</hi> Jer. 2.19. ſuch as care not to walk contrary to God, it is plain they fear him not. All impenitent Sinners, that go <hi>on in their treſpaſſes,</hi> that perſiſt in a courſe of rebellion, they are ſo far from fearing God, that they are daily ſending up <hi>challenges</hi> to Heaven, daring God's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Juſtice, Pſal. 10.13. <hi>wherefore doth the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contemn God?</hi> How unreaſonable, how impious, how inſufferable is it, that wicked wretches ſhould be ſo inſolent, to contemn God? yet ſo it is, the wicked are ſo far from reverencing, that they plainly contemn God. So, he that <hi>being often reproved,</hi> and threatned, yet <hi>hardneth his neck</hi> by his impenitency, by his incorrigibleneſs, does even ſet God <hi>at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance,</hi> as if he bad him do his worſt.</p>
            <p>Remember this, they that fear God, fear to ſin againſt him.</p>
            <p>But you may ask further, May we not avoid ſin, at leaſt ſome ſins, and not from God's Fear?</p>
            <p>Yea, I grant, it may be ſo. But now if we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſin from a principle of <hi>Godly fear</hi>—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In general,</hi> we are departing from <hi>all known ſin,</hi> we dare not allow our ſelves in any ſin we know of. We knowing that all ſin is diſpleaſing to God, if we fear to diſpleaſe God we muſt fear to allow our ſelves in any ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Particularly,</hi> 2. The Fear of God will cauſe us to flee from the <hi>Vices of the times,</hi> (as we diſcover them) from ſins that are moſt <hi>in faſhion.</hi> Let Swearing and Forſwearing be never ſo much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:92979:130"/>yet we ſhall <hi>fear an Oath,</hi> if we fear God. If all the World ſhould <hi>wonder after,</hi> and agree to <hi>worſhip the Beaſt,</hi> yet ſo ſhould not we, becauſe of the Fear of God. No, though we might ſeem to be left alone, as <hi>Eljah</hi> thought he was. Let a ſin be never ſo much pleaded for, countenanced, and generally practiſed, yet theſe things will not take with us, while we hear God ſaying, <hi>Oh, do not this abominable thing, which I hate,</hi> (if we have the Fear of God in our hearts, and before our eyes.) Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall have a greater care, to keep our ſelves from ſuch ſins, the ſtronger temptations we have to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhall fear ſinning <hi>in ſecret</hi> too. Knowing, that God <hi>ſees in ſecret,</hi> that there is <hi>no darkneſs, nor ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves</hi> from him. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his tempting Miſtreſs, <hi>How can</hi> I <hi>do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> He was awed with God's all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing eye upon him, as much as if the eyes of all the World had been upon him. Lev. 19.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe the Deaf, nor put a ſtumbling-block before the Blind: but ſhalt fear thy God.</hi> If one does <hi>curſe the Deaf,</hi> he <hi>hears</hi> not; if one <hi>puts a Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block before the Blind,</hi> he <hi>ſees</hi> not who he is that does it. O, but yet God hears, and he ſees. And ſuch as are endued with his Fear, will not dare to commit ſin, upon this preſumption, that Men ſhall not know, cannot find it out. This would be a ſtrong <hi>aw-band,</hi> and powerful reſtraint, ordinarily to keep them from <hi>deliberate ſinning,</hi> that they can commit no ſin <hi>out of God's ſight,</hi> who cannot but be diſpleaſed at ſin, where ever he ſees it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we fear God, and forſake Sin in his Fear,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:92979:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>then we ſhall fear to diſpleaſe him in <hi>ſmaller matters</hi> too. We ſhall fear to allow of the leaſt Sin. Though there are Sins of <hi>daily incurſion,</hi> that we cannot wholly avoid, yet they not are <hi>allowed of.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſays, Rom. 7.15. <hi>That which I do I allow not</hi>—If we ſometimes ſpeak vainly, raſhly, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have our Paſſions ſinfully moved, if dulneſs, and diſtractions over take us, and diſturb us in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duties; yet we can ſay, we allow not of ſuch things. We are aſhamed of them, grieved, and humbled for them, and deſire to watch againſt them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again, We ſhall fear <hi>ſinning</hi> againſt God, more than <hi>ſuffering</hi> from Men. As <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> when threatned by <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I fear nothing but Sin.</hi> It we fear God, we ſhall not fear Creatures ſo much.</p>
            <p n="6">6. So we ſhall fear <hi>Sin,</hi> more than the Scourge, more than <hi>affliction.</hi> Our fear is <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> of offending, and diſpleaſing God; and <hi>ſecondarily</hi> of the puniſhment. That Fear which is not ſo much of the Sin and Offence, as of the Laſh and Scourge, is but <hi>ſervile</hi> Fear.</p>
            <p n="7">7. So we ſhall not only fear, but alſo <hi>hate</hi> Sin. As there is <hi>love</hi> in our <hi>Fear</hi> of God, there will be <hi>hatred</hi> in our <hi>fear</hi> of Sin, becauſe ſo offenſive, and contrary to God. Thus we ſhall not barely <hi>abſtain from,</hi> but <hi>abhor</hi> that which is evil. Prov. 8.13. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is to hate evil.</hi> Thus it will cauſe us to forſake Sin in practice, and affection both. Do we not know, that not to hate Sin, (the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable thing which God hates) muſt needs be diſpleaſing to God? yea, we are (at leaſt ſecretly) <hi>in league</hi> with Sin, ſo long as we do not hate it.</p>
            <pb n="245" facs="tcp:92979:131"/>
            <p n="2">(2.) Another chief effect of true Fear is ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Will of God, <hi>Obedience</hi> to his Commands. Hereby we muſt try the ſoundneſs of our <hi>Faith.</hi> As that which is called <hi>Faith,</hi> Gal. 5.6. is called <hi>The keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.19. Hereby we muſt try the ſincerity of our <hi>Love,</hi> This <hi>is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3. So hereby we muſt try the genuineneſs of our <hi>Fear.</hi> Eccl. 12.13. <hi>Fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> Pſal. 119.63. And 103.17, 18. They that <hi>fear God,</hi> are further deſcribed to be <hi>ſuch as keep his Covenant, and remember his Commandments to do them.</hi> Here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 1. Where the Fear of God is, there will be a <hi>fearing,</hi> reverencing of his Commands. <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.13. Who ſo deſpiſeth the Word, ſhall be deſtroyed; but <hi>he that feareth the Commandment</hi> ſhall be rewarded. One that <hi>feareth</hi> God, dares not <hi>deſpiſe</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. At leaſt, if he has done it, (as we read of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.10.) when he comes to ſee it, he cannot but loath himſelf. And obſerve, the <hi>reward</hi> is promiſed, not to the bare performance of things commanded, not to meer external obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but to that obedience which flows from a <hi>due reſpect</hi> to the Authority of God commanding. Not to that, which is meerly from <hi>fear of the threatning,</hi> but to that which is out of <hi>reverence,</hi> and an aweful reſpect <hi>to the Command</hi> it ſelf. <hi>He that feareth the Commandment ſhall be rewarded.</hi> Many fear God's threatnings, that do not reverence his Commands. But ſuch as <hi>tremble at the Word</hi> (Iſa. 66.2.) ſuchas have a reverent regard to the whole Word of God, ſuch as <hi>tremble at the Commandment of our God</hi> (as Ezr. 10.3.) they have a right Fear of God. The
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:92979:132"/>Pſalmiſt did not ſtand in that awe to Princes, as to God's Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.161. <hi>Princes have perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted me without a cauſe: but my heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> Thus thoſe three Princes, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 18.) ſhewed that they feared God indeed, when they regarded not the King's Decree, being contrary to the Law of God. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> chap. 6.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When there is a true <hi>Child-like Fear</hi> of God, there is not only a <hi>reverencing</hi> of his Commands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Commands of Men; but alſo a <hi>delight</hi> in God's Commands. As a Child-like reverence is a mixt affection, a <hi>compound</hi> of both. And this Note we have in the Text, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commandments.</hi> That is, better pleaſed in doing the will of God, than in doing, or having his own will. So Pſal. 119.161, 162. <hi>My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> (But that is not all) <hi>I rejoyce at thy Word, as one that findeth great ſpoil.</hi> As a dutiful Child not only fears to go croſs to his Fathers command; but is alſo glad, when he can do any thing pleaſing to his Father. So a Child of God obeyeth from the heart, and <hi>delighteth to do God's will.</hi> That obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which is from a ſlaviſh fear, is forced and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted. As <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid, I <hi>forced my ſelf and offered a burnt offering.</hi> To allude to the expreſſion, ſome force themſelves, and go to God's Worſhip; force themſelves, and ſet up prayer in their Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not that they have any love to ſuch work, but becauſe otherwiſe their Conſciences are not quiet. Whereas that Obedience, which is from a filial Fear, is <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt could ſay, Pſal. 119.167, 168, 173. <hi>My Soul hath
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:92979:132"/>kept thy Teſtimonies: and I love them exceedingly.</hi> For all my ways are before thee. <hi>I have choſen the way of thy Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The true Fear of God will cauſe an <hi>impartial reſpect</hi> to all God's Commands. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. Only <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſerve him</hi> in truth <hi>with all your heart.</hi> Deut. 10.12. To <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to walk in all his wayes,</hi> go to gether. Pro. 14.2. <hi>He that walketh in his uprightneſs, feareth the Lord;</hi> but he that is perverſe in his ways, diſpiſeth him. To <hi>walk in uprightneſs,</hi> is a ſure note that one <hi>fears</hi> the Lord. So we read of <hi>Job,</hi> That Man was <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> and <hi>one that feared God,</hi> chap. 1.1. But to halt in our courſe, to be ſet upon any <hi>crooked paths,</hi> which we know to be croſs and contrary to God's Commands, is to <hi>deſpiſe the Lord.</hi> Num. 15.30, 31. The <hi>Soul that doth ought preſumptuouſly</hi>—the <hi>ſame reproacheth the Lord — he hath deſpiſed the Word of the Lord.</hi> The Soul that doth ought <hi>preſumptuouſly,</hi> that <hi>Sciens volens,</hi> knowingly, and wittingly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth, that ſinneth with an <hi>high hand,</hi> proudly, wilfully, reſolvedly, <hi>the ſame reproacheth the Lord,</hi> he is a proud blaſphemous contemner of the Lord. He hath (manifeſtly) <hi>deſpiſed the Word of the Lord.</hi> To deſpiſe any known Command of his, is not to fear, but to contemn the Lord. But on the other hand, the Lord ſayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22.12. <hi>Now I know, that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy Son, thine only Son from me. Now I know,</hi> ſpeaking <hi>after the manner of Men.</hi> Herein <hi>Abraham</hi> gave a moſt clear proof of his Fear of the Lord. That he was ſo ready at God's Command, to <hi>offer up his Iſaac</hi> a Sacrifice, this was an evident teſtification, that he feared God. So as we would
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:92979:133"/>ſhew, that we truly fear God, we muſt be ready to obey him in whatſoever he commandeth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Fear of God will produce a continued, conſtant reſpect to God, and his Commands. That we ſhall <hi>walk in his Fear.</hi> As Act. 9.31. Neh. 5.9. <hi>Ought ye not to walk in the Fear of our God?</hi> Pro. 23.17. <hi>Be thou in the Fear of the Lord all the day. Totâ die,</hi> there is as much as <hi>quotidie, vel omni die. All the day,</hi> that is, continually, <hi>every day.</hi> Pro. 28.14. <hi>Happy is the man that feareth alway.</hi> Jer. 32.39, 40. <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever— I will put my Fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Such as have the true Fear of God in their hearts, will not depart from him. There is a Fear that <hi>drives</hi> Souls <hi>from</hi> God: But true genuine Fear will keep a Soul <hi>cloſe</hi> to him, will make it careful not to ſtart aſide from him. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is a fountain of life,</hi> it is not a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient paſſion, but an <hi>abiding principal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Effect (or if you will, one <hi>ſpecial Act</hi>) of true Fear, is an holy <hi>Reverence in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> Pſal. 5.7. <hi>In thy Fear will I Worſhip</hi> —And there is no Worſhip acceptable without Reverence. An inward Reverence is as the <hi>Soul</hi> of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Some diſtinguiſh holy Fear <hi>in timorem cultûs, et culpae,</hi> into a Reverence in worſhipping, and a fear of offending. How ever theſe may be <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,</hi> they cannot be ſeparated, or <hi>divided.</hi> Sure, they have not a Fear of offending God, that have not an holy Fear, and reverence in his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>They that <hi>groſly neglect</hi> God's Worſhip, plainly ſhew themſelves to be <hi>void of his Fear.</hi> Job. 15.4. <hi>Thou caſteſt off Fear, and reſtraineſt Prayer before God.</hi> Though it was falſly charged on <hi>Job,</hi> this yet will
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:92979:133"/>hold true, they that <hi>caſt off Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. thereby ſhew, that they have <hi>caſt off God's Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they are little better, who are <hi>groſly negligent,</hi> and without any inward Reverence in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>If I be a Maſter, where is my Fear?</hi> ſaid the Lord unto thoſe that <hi>deſpiſed his Name</hi> in offering to him the <hi>blind</hi> for Sacrifice, and that which was <hi>torn,</hi> and the <hi>lame,</hi> and the <hi>ſick</hi> Mal. 1.6, 8, 13. If we are poſſeſſed of the Fear of God, how ſhall we be awed (when attending on his Ordinances) with thoughts of being in his ſpecial Preſence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſtrict Eye, that obſerves our very hearts, and all our carriage in his Service; we ſhould dread to think of <hi>taking</hi> his ſacred, and reverent <hi>Name in vain.</hi> We ſhall be ſeriouſly, deeply affected with what the Lord hath ſaid, that he <hi>will be ſanctified in them that come nigh him,</hi> Lev. 10.3. He is <hi>greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of his Saints: and to be had in Reverence of all them that are about him,</hi> Pſal. 89.7. But if ordinarily we care not how unpreparedly we ruſh into God's preſence, take no heed to <hi>our feet,</hi> to our thoughts, and affections, when we are to go to God in Prayer, or to receive the Law from his mouth, or to attend on him in any other holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and Duty; and if we are ordinarily raſh, and rude, careleſs and cuſtomary in the Services we preſent unto him, what would this ſhew, but a <hi>profane ſpirit,</hi> and that we <hi>know not our diſtance,</hi> nor have any due Fear of God?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The true Fear of God will teach us to carry as in <hi>God's preſence,</hi> in our ordinary courſe, which is <hi>walking in his Fear,</hi> Eccl. 8.12. <hi>It ſhall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</hi> Fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that is, are ſtill awed with his Preſence.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:92979:134"/>Thus the Fear of God has an influence upon a Man's ordinary courſe. It will cauſe him to walk <hi>circumſpectly.</hi> He will ſtudy to <hi>walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing.</hi> Not that any do, or can in <hi>a ſtrict ſenſe</hi> walk worthy of the Lord. A worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>exact proportion</hi> here is impoſſible. There is no walking worthy of the Lord <hi>ſecundum propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am et abſolutam condignitatem,</hi> according to proper <hi>condignity,</hi> but only <hi>ſecundum quandam congruitatem, et condecentiam,</hi> with ſome meaſure of <hi>condecency.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in ſome meaſure <hi>ſutably</hi> to our <hi>Relation</hi> unto ſuch an holy God, and agreeably to the profeſſion of his Name. This <hi>exact walking,</hi> the Fear of God teacheth. As the Pſalmiſt, 16.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me. I foreſaw the Lord always before my face,</hi> as it is, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25. I ſtill conſidered, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon God as preſent with me, an obſerver, and <hi>Arbiter</hi> of all my thoughts, words, and actions. The Fear of God will thus ſet us in God's Preſence, and keep us there. So it will not only keep us <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> in <hi>holy Duties,</hi> wherein we draw nigh to God after a ſpecial manner; but will alſo make us circumſpect, and <hi>watchful</hi> in our <hi>ordinary converſations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Fear of God would ordinarily regulate us in <hi>natural actions.</hi> Cauſe us to eat, and drink in Fear, contrary to thoſe we read of, <hi>Jude</hi> 17. <hi>feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves without Fear.</hi> The Fear of God would teach us, <hi>whether we eat, or drink, or what ever we do, to do all to the Glory of God.</hi> When the Glory of God is not <hi>habitually</hi> intended in ones general courſe, and frequently <hi>actually</hi> intended alſo, there is little ſign of the Fear of God.</p>
            <p>So the Fear of God would make Men conſcionable
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:92979:134"/>in <hi>civil Actions,</hi> in their places, relations, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral employments in the World. The Fear of God would make a juſt and a good Magiſtrate. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. <hi>He that ruleth over Men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the Fear of God.</hi> See 2 Chro. 19.9. <hi>The unjuſt Judg</hi> in the Parable was one that <hi>feared not God,</hi> Luk. 18.2, 6. The Fear of God would make good Subjects too. This will teach us to be <hi>ſubject for the Lord's ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. <hi>For Conſcience ſake,</hi> Rom. 13.5. This would mould and work the heart to the beſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and officiouſneſs towards others. Epheſ. 5.21. <hi>Submitting your ſelves one to another in the Fear of God.</hi> The Fear of God is a ſtrong and powerful motive, and impulſive, and alſo a good Rule, and Meaſure in this Caſe. This will make good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5. How diligent and faithful will ſuch be, who in their ſerving Men, ſtill have an eye on their Maſter in Heaven? Whatever relation one is in, it would be ſtrange indeed if ſuch an one that fears God, ſhould not carry better than thoſe which have not his Fear. So this would generally regulate Men in their Trades, Bargaining, and worldly Commerce.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The true Fear of God uſeth to produce a <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fear,</hi> and a <hi>jealous fear:</hi> A <hi>cautious fear,</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to <hi>avoid temptations,</hi> and occaſions of ſin, and to <hi>ſhun the appearance</hi> of evil. What ſeemeth to be ſinful, or is very like it; In <hi>doubtful caſes,</hi> the Fear of God will encline us ordinarily to follow the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt courſe. So likewiſe it produceth a <hi>jealous fear</hi> of our ſelves, of our ſinful and deceitful hearts. Fear is the <hi>Centinel</hi> of the Soul, to give notice of danger. It will not ſuffer us to <hi>dwell careleſly,</hi> like the Men of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> Judg. 18.7. It will ſet, and keep
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:92979:135"/>us <hi>on our Watch.</hi> It is an enemy to Security, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and Self-confidence. It will teach us to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> and to <hi>paſs the time of our ſojourning here in Fear,</hi> (Phil. 2.12. 1 Pet. 1.17.)</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Fear of God oppoſeth the <hi>predominancy</hi> of baſe <hi>carnal fear.</hi> It is a good <hi>guard</hi> againſt the ſinful fear of Man; a good <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt <hi>faint-heartedneſs</hi> in the Cauſe of God: a cure of baſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cowardiſe. Such as fear God, know he has ways enow to deliver his Servants, how great ſoever their perils may be. As they ſaid, Dan. 3.17. <hi>Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us.</hi> Or however, if he ſhould not work their Deliverance here; yet in periſhing for God they ſhould be full ſafe; in loſing their lives they ſhould ſave them. <hi>In the Fear of the Lord is ſtrong confidence.</hi> And further, they that truly fear God, will more dread the thoughts of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from God, than any <hi>Perſecution</hi> from Men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Fear of God promotes true humility. And ſo it oppoſeth Pride, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.) Indeed reverence and humility towards God are very near a-kind. Further, The Fear of God teacheth an humble carriage towards Men. As we ſee there, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.21. (But of Humility I ſhall diſcourſe next.)</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Fear of God will encline us to <hi>pitty</hi> our poor Brethren, that are any way laid under God's diſpleaſure. Job 6.14. <hi>To him that is afflicted, pity ſhould be ſhewed from his friend; but he forſaketh the Fear of the Almighty.</hi> He that does not ſhew pity, thinks not how juſtly, and how eaſily the <hi>Almighty</hi> may contend with him for it. The Fear of God,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:92979:135"/>and <hi>hard-heartedneſs</hi> towards Men under the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God, are things that do not agree.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The true genuine Fear of God is for <hi>propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its kind.</hi> If we have it, we ſhall deſire to <hi>teach others God's Fear,</hi> and to promote it in others. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> that feared God, would <hi>teach his Children, and his Houſhold after him, to keep the way of the Lord.</hi> As the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 34.11. <hi>Come ye Children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the Fear of the Lord.</hi> As he took up his fellow, Luk. 23.40. <hi>Doſt not thou fear God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So if we have the Fear of God, we ſhall deſire to eſtabliſh and confirm others in his Fear. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another.</hi> They thought on God's Name ſtill, and would be ſpeaking for God, and his ways, even then when the mouth of Blaſphemy was moſt open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. They would be confirming one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the belief of God's Providence, Juſtice, Goodneſs, Truth, and Faithfulneſs, how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wicked Atheiſts diſputed, and denied them. Thus they that are acquainted with the true Fear of God, are real Friends to it, would promote it in others what they can.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If we have the Fear of God, we are for <hi>making progreſs in Holineſs.</hi> The true Fear of God, as it oppoſeth all Sin, it will be quickning unto, and in every Duty, and will befriend every Grace. And that is right indeed, when we are <hi>perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. though here it be not fully perfected. So much of the Effects of God's Fear.</p>
            <p n="5">5. True Fear may be known by the <hi>Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:92979:136"/>of it, by its Companions. Though I ſhall but touch on a few of theſe very briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> go together, that's right. As we read of <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> Heb. 11.7. Pſal. 15.11. <hi>Ye that fear the Lord, truſt in the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 33.18. <hi>Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him; upon them that hope in his Mercy.</hi> And the Lord takes pleaſure in ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11. That is not a right Fear, which is the <hi>Van-guard</hi> of Horrour and Deſpair. A fear of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is no bleſſed thing. Though (it's true) ſome degrees of this may be with true Faith and Fear.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 101.1. <hi>I will ſing of Mercy and Judgment</hi>] The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe hath thus: <hi>If thou dealeſt mercifully with me, if thou doſt Judgment with me, for all I will ſing Praiſe.</hi> And ſo ſome take it thus; I will not <hi>preſume</hi> of thy <hi>Mercy</hi> ſo, as not to fear thy <hi>Judgment;</hi> nor ſo <hi>fear</hi> thy <hi>Judgment,</hi> as to <hi>deſpair</hi> of thy <hi>Mercy.</hi> Which I offer but as an Alluſion, not as the Senſe.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) When <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> go together, that's right. The true Fear of God is ſeated in a <hi>poor and contrite ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 66.2. <hi>Godly Fear,</hi> and <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> are undivided <hi>Companions.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.11. <hi>Behold, this ſelf-ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you,—yea, what fear?</hi> Which Text ſeems to make <hi>Fear</hi> the <hi>Daughter of Repentance,</hi> or Godly Sorrow. And like <hi>Naomi</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> they never part. There is a phraſe, Iſa. 63.17. <hi>Why haſt thou hardned our hearts from thy Fear?</hi> Which implieth ſo much, that an Heart which is <hi>hardned,</hi> is no-way <hi>diſpoſed to his Fear.</hi> So Prov. 28.14. <hi>Happy is the Man that feareth alway:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:92979:136"/>but he that hardneth his heart, ſhall fall into miſchief.</hi> Where we ſee, he that <hi>hardneth his heart,</hi> is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Man that <hi>feareth</hi> with a bleſſed Fear.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) When <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> go together, that's right. When theſe go hand in hand, it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a filial fear. But no doubt that is a ſinful fear, which drives ſouls from God, which is contrary to the Love of God. O <hi>dread ſuch Fear!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) How comfortable is it, when <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in the Lord go together! Though I muſt confeſs, all that fear God, cannot find this Joy. There are that <hi>fear</hi> the Lord, and that yet <hi>walk in darkneſs,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. But as the moſt High is to be feared, we ſhould <hi>rejoice in his Highneſs</hi> too. As thoſe good Women who came to ſeek Jeſus, departed from the Sepulchre with <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>great joy,</hi> Mat. 28.8. It is an happy thing indeed, when our fear of the Lord is joyned with ſpiritual delight in him, and his ſervice. Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</hi> So let us labour to be like thoſe, Act. 9.31. that <hi>walked in the Fear of the Lord, and in the Comfort of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

It is a good expreſſion one has, <hi>Humility emptieth the heart for God to fill it.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is a <hi>Nurſekeeper</hi> of other Graces. <hi>Radix om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium malorum ſuperbia, &amp; cuſtos omnium virtutum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militas eſt. When I am weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. And a Chriſtian's <hi>ſtrength</hi> lieth very much in an humble <hi>ſenſe</hi> of his own <hi>weakneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humility</hi> is a great <hi>preſervative</hi> from <hi>Temptation.</hi> Such as lie low, are ſafeſt, moſt out of the way of <hi>Satan's Gun-ſhot.</hi> But Souls that are <hi>lifted up,</hi> ſtand as a fair <hi>mark</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>Humility is the <hi>way to Glory. Chilo</hi> asking <hi>Aeſop</hi> what God was doing? he anſwered, That he does humble the Lofty,

He <hi>brings down high things,</hi> and <hi>ſets up low things.</hi> Luk. 14.11. <hi>He that humbleth himſelf, ſhal be exalted.</hi> But ſelf-exaltation is ſelf-deſtruction. <hi>Pride goeth before a Fall.</hi> To be lifted up, is the <hi>high-way to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:92979:138"/>ruine.</hi> We are no nearer Heaven for lifting up our ſelves. But God is ready graciouſly to condeſcend to thoſe that humble themſelves, and lie low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. The <hi>moſt High</hi> hath a ſpecial <hi>reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are lowly.</hi> He hath promiſed to <hi>dwell</hi> with them that are of an <hi>humble and contrite ſpirit,</hi> (Iſa. 57.15.) and ſuch he will in due time take up, to dwell with him for ever.</p>
            <p>But what is this <hi>Humility?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">[1] I ſhall tell you in the Negative, what it is not. So,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is not a minding <hi>low and baſe things of the World.</hi> Though the words <hi>[humilis &amp; humilitas]</hi> be derived from <hi>humus,</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> or Earth; yet Humility is not a <hi>minding earthly things,</hi> not a <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our affections on things on the Earth.</hi> No: We may be lowly-minded, and heavenly-minded both. Indeed earthly Riches, worldly Honours, that ſeem to many to be great matters, high things, yet are but mean, and baſe things, compared with the <hi>things above.</hi> And yet we may ſeek the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and be humble too: or we may be very proud, while taken with things below.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Humility lieth not in ones affecting the pooreſt habit, or <hi>affecting</hi> any <hi>add dreſs,</hi> (how mean ſo ever) that he may not ſeem to be proud. Yet miſtake me not: I ſpeak not this to <hi>cloke</hi> the proud gawdineſs of any. Exceſs in coſtly Attire, in vain, ſtrange, and light, immodeſt faſhions, is a great <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> of our times. Oh, how many that this way <hi>glory in their ſhame!</hi> were the <hi>Daughters of Zion</hi> (reproved, and threatned for this ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.) ever more guilty, than multitudes among us at this day?</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:92979:138"/>
            <p>But yet I muſt tell you, a <hi>proud heart</hi> may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>vile raiment</hi> too. I trample on <hi>Plato's</hi> pride (ſaid <hi>Diogenes.</hi>)
<note place="margin">Laert. in Diogene. l. 6. p. 381.</note> But with another kind of pride (ſaid <hi>Plato.</hi>) Thus ſome may be proud of an <hi>affected plainneſs,</hi> proud of their ſeeming free from pride, of their looking like humble, mortified Men. And ſome there are, whoſe pride lies not in ſuch gawds, as <hi>fine Clothes,</hi> (which one would think, none but Children, and Fools ſhould be taken with:) but in an high conceit of themſelves, their Knowledg, <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Humility is not a baſe, <hi>abject diſpoſition,</hi> or ſuch a dejected frame of ſpirit, as takes a Man off from his work, and duty. A <hi>deſpondent mind</hi> makes a Man fit for nothing: makes a Man a burden to himſelf, a burden to others, to the World. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we may meet with Perſons, ſo far <hi>out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> with themſelves, that they think themſelves unfit for any company, for any imployment, and cannot be drawn to lay out any Abilities, Gift, or Talent they have. Such <hi>puſillanimity</hi> is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing from true Humility: not a <hi>Vertue,</hi> but an <hi>evil Diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) A baſe unworthy <hi>crouching</hi> unto Men, and ſinful compliance with them, this is not Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A yeilding to the will, and humours of Men, (contrary to the will of God) either for fear, or to obtain their favour. This is not true Humility, to <hi>honour Men above the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) A <hi>denial</hi> of what God hath given us, or hath done for us, this is <hi>unthankfulneſs,</hi> not Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. As <hi>there is that maketh himſelf rich,</hi> and <hi>yet hath nothing; there is again that maketh himſelf poor, yes hath great riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:92979:139"/>
            <p n="6">(6.) A lowly, courteous, <hi>affable carriage</hi> towards all, even towards inferiours; though it is good and commendable, (where it is not uſed to <hi>ſerve</hi> ones pride and <hi>ambition,</hi> as <hi>Abſalom</hi> uſed it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.5, 6.) yet it is not ſufficient, to prove one endued with the <hi>Grace of Humility. Good Nature</hi> may teach Courteouſneſs towards Men, where there is no Principle, or ſpark of <hi>Grace.</hi> The Grace of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhews it ſelf, not only in <hi>reſpect to Men,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in its reſpect towards God.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) There is an <hi>artificial,</hi> hypocritical Humility. As ſome have an <hi>Art of diſcommending</hi> what they have, or do, to draw commendations from others. And Hypocrites may be forward to <hi>confeſs</hi> ſuch ſins as the beſt, and moſt ſincere are not free from (while here) concluding, that they ſhall be never the worſe thought of for this; yea, hoping by ſuch confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and complaints of themſelves, they ſhall gain the repute of ſerious, <hi>humble Souls.</hi> Now this is but the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of Humility, or <hi>masked</hi> pride, pride <hi>under a veil.</hi> True Humility God loves, it is very pleaſing to him: but this which is only <hi>painted,</hi> is loathſom to him.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) We may have a <hi>diſlike of Pride</hi> in others, without true Humility. There are ſome, whoſe pride makes them forward to cenſure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn pride in others. As <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">I aert. l. 6. in Diog. p. 389.</note> 
               <hi>Noli mihi umbram facere:</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure that others ſhould <hi>ſtand in their light,</hi> or ſhade, and obſcure them. They take it as a wrong to them, if others come near them, much more if they put them down.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) There is a kind of <hi>humiliation</hi> without Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:92979:139"/>Though God ordereth the <hi>humiliation</hi> of his People to the working and encreaſing of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in them; yet there is a difference betwixt <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> and many have been humbled, who yet were not humble. <hi>Pharoah</hi> was humbled under God's Judgments; yet had he a proud, ſtout, and ſtubborn ſpirit, that would not yeild to God. Many are brought low in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and yet their ſpirits are high ſtill. Inſtead of <hi>humbling</hi> themſelves under God's afflicting hand, and being willing to lie down at his feet, their <hi>hearts fret againſt the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are humbled <hi>under Terrours,</hi> under a ſenſe of God's Wrath, and brought full low in their own apprehenſion; even to the <hi>gates of Hell,</hi> and the brink of Deſpair; when all is but a <hi>forced</hi> humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Though as this tends to make them truly humble, if it comes to have this <hi>effect,</hi> it will be very comfortable in the end. Otherwiſe no comfort is to be taken in it. As <hi>Bernard</hi> noteth, it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">In Cant. Ser. 34.</note> 
               <hi>He that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf, ſhall be exalted.</hi> It ſignifies not that all Humility ſhall have exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on following it: but that, <hi>quae de voluntate venit, non ex triſtitia, nec ex neceſſitate.</hi> Which is voluntary, not involuntary, or forced. As on the contrary, it is not ſaid, <hi>omnis qui exaltatur — every one that is exalted,</hi> ſhall be abaſed: but only, <hi>qui ſe exaltat, he that exalts himſelf.</hi> Indeed he is moſt properly ſaid to <hi>humble himſelf,</hi> that does it freely, <hi>willingly,</hi> whoſe heart is to the work. And thus <hi>Ahab</hi> did not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf. That humiliation is without Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is not free and voluntary. (But of this more after.)</p>
            <pb n="262" facs="tcp:92979:140"/>
            <p n="2">[2.] I come to ſhew <hi>poſitively</hi> what Humility is.</p>

               <q>Humility is a Vertue, whereby a Man, from the true knowledg of himſelf becomes vile in his own ſight.</q> If this account be thought too ſhort, take this deſcription of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humility</hi> is a Grace, or <hi>Chriſtian Vertue,</hi> whereby a Man from a <hi>ſound knowledg</hi> of God, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hath <hi>low thoughts</hi> of himſelf, is <hi>content</hi> with the place and ſtate wherein God ſets him, and readily <hi>ſubmits</hi> himſelf unto God, and unto Men, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God, and for his ſake.</p>
            <p>This deſcription takes in <hi>both parts</hi> of Humility, <hi>(Humilitas duplex, altera cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bern.</note>

So likewiſe it takes in the double <hi>reſpect</hi> Humility beareth, <hi>towards God</hi> firſt, and then <hi>towards Men,</hi> according to his will in ſubordination to him.</p>
            <p>Now I come to ſhew, how we may know whether we are indued with this Grace of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or no?</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) True Humility is <hi>founded in Knowledg</hi> and Wiſdome. And ſo much the Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:92979:140"/>may intimate. As we read, Prov. 11.2. <hi>with the lowly is Wiſdom. Pride</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> pride and ignorance go together. So on the contrary, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſound Knowledg, Humility and true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Indeed there is a <hi>Knowledg</hi> that <hi>puffeth up;</hi> but it is not <hi>ſound</hi> Knowledg. But with true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility there is a ſound Knowledg (I do not ſay perfect, but ſound Knowledg) of God, and of ones ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There is a <hi>knowledg of God</hi> in his <hi>Excellencies.</hi> And this promotes true Humility. Job 42.5, 6. <hi>Now mine eye ſeeth thee: wherefore I abhor my ſelf.</hi> Since thou haſt pleaſed to reveal, and make known more of thy ſelf, thy Power, Juſtice, Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since thy Glory and Excellency is more manifeſt unto me, I cannot but have lower, and worſe thoughts of my ſelf, than ever. Now I ſee my ſelf to <hi>be vile</hi> indeed. Beloved, the knowledg of God is that which <hi>keeps the Angels</hi> in Heaven <hi>humble.</hi> Though they have no ſin to be humbled for; though they are indued with ſuch <hi>rare Perfections,</hi> both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> though they <hi>excel in ſtrength,</hi> (as what is the power of an Army to the power of an Angel, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35?) and excel in <hi>Wiſdome</hi> (to be <hi>wiſe, as an Angel of God,</hi> what an high degree of Wiſdom is that?) and though they have a ſpotleſs holineſs; yet are they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of an infinite diſtance, and <hi>diſparity</hi> betwixt them, and God the <hi>Father of Spirits.</hi> That their life, and light is borrowed, and that the higheſt created excellencies found in them, compared with the Divine Perfections of their Maker, Preſerver and gracious Governour, are not ſo much as a <hi>drop</hi> to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> not ſo much as a ſingle ray to the Sun it
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:92979:141"/>ſelf. And Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>lowly in ſpirit,</hi> Mat. 11.29. Though he was without ſin, and <hi>higher than the Angels;</hi> yet having taken our nature upon him, he knew it became him, to humble himſelf to God, to ſtoop to any condition, to ſtoop to the Croſs, to the moſt painful undertaking, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was pleaſed to call him unto.</p>
            <p>Thou that haſt not attained to ſuch a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, as teacheth to admire him above all the World, and to look upon thy ſelf as baſe, and vile indeed, <hi>as a Worm,</hi> and no Man, that is, moſt <hi>contemptible,</hi> of no account or worth (<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.7.) thou art yet a ſtranger to this Grace of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There is a knowledge of our ſelves, and of <hi>ſelf-imperfections,</hi> neceſſary to beget true Humility. Here generally we are very ſhort. Few that know themſelves aright. If there be any thing, wherein we may ſeem to excell our Neighbours, we are very willing to take notice of that. Though <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>face ſhone, and he knew it not,</hi> (Exod. 34.29.) there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, but if they any way outſhine others, they know it too well. If they have Learning, quick parts, gifts of Memory, Utterance, or the like; nay, if they have but a <hi>fair outſide</hi> (though a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sign-poſte may have gilt, and fair colours laid upon it) they can ſcarce look off from ſuch things. But how few that would know, how frail they are, and how ſinful they are? The moſt have no mind to look on their defects: but are willing here to be ſtrangers to themſelves. Thus Pride gets ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: whereas right <hi>ſelf-knowledg,</hi> true ſelf-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance would work Humility, and cauſe <hi>ſelf-abhorrence.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="265" facs="tcp:92979:141"/>
            <p>As 1. If we know our ſelves aright, we know our ſelves to be <hi>but creatures.</hi> And what have Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be proud of? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</hi> Any good that a Creature hath, (whether <hi>Natural, Moral,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi>) is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, derived from God. So the Creature owes all he has to God. And ſhall we be proud of a borrowed Coat? Shall a Steward be proud of his Lords Money, which he receives, but muſt account for? Shall we be proud of that which is <hi>none of our own?</hi> Is not our Maker, our <hi>Owner?</hi> Did he not make all things for himſelf? Is he not <hi>Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor</hi> of the whole World? The <hi>Silver</hi> is <hi>his,</hi> and the <hi>Gold</hi> is <hi>his.</hi> The <hi>Cattle on a thouſand Hills</hi> are <hi>his. The Earth is the Lord's and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> Yea, <hi>all Souls are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely the <hi>dependance,</hi> that a Creature hath upon his Creatour, calleth for the moſt <hi>humble ſubmiſſion</hi> to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we know our ſelves aright, we know our ſelves to be very <hi>ſinful Creatures.</hi> And ſhall not this humble us? As the <hi>Publican</hi> was <hi>aſhamed to lift up his eyes to Heaven,</hi> being <hi>a ſinner,</hi> Luk. 18.13. Indeed pride is altogether <hi>unbeſeeming</hi> an <hi>innocent</hi> Creature; yea, the Creature cannot be <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> together. Neither Man, nor Angels could keep their <hi>Innocency,</hi> without retaining their <hi>Humility.</hi> And ſurely Pride <hi>leſs becomes</hi> a <hi>ſinful</hi> Creature, who has this to humble him, that he is ſinful. A <hi>proud ſinner</hi> would be far worſe than a <hi>proud Beggar,</hi> (that every one will cry ſhame on) but that he alſo is a ſinner.</p>
            <p>If we rightly underſtand what we are <hi>by nature,</hi> we know our ſelves to be ſo <hi>vile, that our own Cloaths</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:92979:142"/>might <hi>abhor</hi> us. If our own cloaths were capable of ſhame, they might be aſhamed to touch, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a <hi>maſs of corruption,</hi> as every Mothers Child of us is by Nature.</p>
            <p>And if we know what our lives have been, we muſt ſee our ſelves <hi>abominable and filthy, who have drunk in iniquity like Water.</hi> Surely they know not themſelves to be <hi>ſinners,</hi> or full little know <hi>what ſin is,</hi> who are lifted up with high conceits of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cheriſh pride in their hearts.</p>
            <p>What is it that any are proud of? Conſider, and then judge, whether a ſinner has not great cauſe (on the contrary) to be humbled.</p>
            <p>Some are proud of their <hi>Birth,</hi> that they have Noble Blood running in their Veins. But what cauſe has a ſinner to be humbled? Our Blood is <hi>tainted, ſtain'd</hi> with the guilt of Original Sin, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our Parents. <hi>We are Children of wrath by Nature.</hi> We were <hi>ſhapen in ſin</hi> and conceived in iniquity. Some are proud of their <hi>Dignities, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</hi> But <hi>Man being in honour abode not in it,</hi> but <hi>became like the Beaſts that periſh. The Crown is fallen from our Heads, wo to us that we have ſinned!</hi> What cauſe have ſinners to be humbled, who have not only loſt that <hi>large dominion</hi> over other Creatures, which Man had at firſt, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 28.) but have ſo far loſt their own <hi>freedom,</hi> have ſold themſelves, are <hi>captives</hi> to Satan, <hi>ſlaves</hi> to divers Luſts? Such who know what it is to be in bondage to Sin, and Satan, and are convinced of being in ſuch a ſtate, will ſee no cauſe to be puffed up with their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Some are proud of their <hi>Strength.</hi> But when a Sinner comes to know himſelf, he ſees himſelf to be <hi>without ſtrength.</hi> (Rom. 5.6.) That if
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:92979:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>he be left to himſelf, there is no Temptation, but would prove too hard for him. That his Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are utterly too hard for him. That he is not able rightly to diſcharge any Duty of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Some are proud of their <hi>Riches.</hi> But the Sinner, that knows himſelf, ſees himſelf run out of all, with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> Luk. 15.14. That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he can call his own, but Sin, and Miſery. That he hath forfeited all, cannot lay claim to the leaſt of God's Mercies. That he owes more than ten thouſand Talents, where he is not able to pay the leaſt Farthing.</p>
            <p>Some are proud of their <hi>Beauty.</hi> But the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that knows himſelf, ſees himſelf to be a very deformed Creature, the <hi>Image of God</hi> (which was Mans Beauty and Glory) <hi>ſadly defaced</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>Some ſo childiſh, as they are proud of <hi>fine Clothes,</hi> of their <hi>Bravery.</hi> But the Sinner that knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſees his nakedneſs, or that he hath none but <hi>filthy Garments</hi> of his own, that his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is but as a <hi>filthy rag.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are proud of their <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Parts.</hi> But the Sinner that knows himſelf, will be ready to confeſs, and cry ſhame on himſelf, as <hi>Agur,</hi> I <hi>have not the underſtanding of a Man.</hi> (Pro. 30.2.) as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt (73.22) <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, and as a Beaſt before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are proud of their ſuppoſed Goodneſs, and <hi>Vertues.</hi> But the Sinner that knows himſelf, ſees his <hi>Gold</hi> to be but <hi>Droſs,</hi> his faireſt Vertues to be but <hi>gliſtering Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs, if ever we were made humble, it was this way, by being made to know our ſelves, what we were. And why was <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſo proud, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:92979:143"/>ſhe knew not, that ſhe was wretched, and miſerable, and <hi>poor and blind and naked?</hi> Rev. 3.17.</p>
            <p>And as this Knowledg of our ſelves is neceſſary to <hi>make</hi> us humble; So to <hi>keep</hi> us <hi>humble.</hi> As this kept the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> humble, thinking what a ſinner he had been. Hereupon he looked on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>as the leaſt of all the Apoſtles, and not meet to be called an Apoſtle,</hi> becauſe he had been a Perſecutor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. And in another place, he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>The leaſt of all Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo thoſe <hi>remainders</hi> of corruption, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defects, which the beſt of God's Saints find in themſelves (while here) make them <hi>walk humbly</hi> all their dayes. Chriſtians that are much in ſtrict ſelf-ſearching, and ſerious ſelf-reflection, though they have <hi>more Grace</hi> than others, that greatly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſame, will ſee enough in themſelves to keep them humble. Yea, I ſuppoſe, ſuch are the <hi>moſt humble</hi> Chriſtians, ſeeing more clearly, and oftner obſerving ſo great defects in their beſt Graces, Duties, Services, and ſo much contrary thereunto in themſelves. That there is ſo much darkneſs, ignorance ſtill in them, that they have no more ſound, ſpiritual Knowledg; and ſo much unbelief, diſtruſt, no more Faith and truſt in God; ſo much worldly ſorrow for outward loſſes, croſſes here, and ſo little Godly ſorrow for their own, and others ſins; and ſo much inordinate love to the World, and worldly things, and ſo little love to God, and Jeſus Chriſt; ſo much baſe carnal fear of Creatures, and temporal evils, and ſo little of a true child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fear of God; ſo much pride, and ſelf-conceit, no more Humility, and ſelf-abaſement; ſo much ſelfiſhneſs, no more ſelf-denial; ſo much guile, no
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:92979:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>more plainheartedneſs and ſincerity; ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs, no more zeal. That there is ſo much backwardneſs to Duty, ſtraitneſs, deadneſs, and diſtraction in holy Duties, no more life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; that there is ſo much impatience, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unthankfulneſs, no more ſubmiſſion unto God, that they are no higher in his praiſe. That they ſerve God no better, honour him no more. The more that any of us know our ſelves, the more we ſhould ſee cauſe to be humble, and humbled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we know our ſelves aright, we know our ſelves to be very impotent, very indigent, frail and mutable, yea <hi>miſerable creatures,</hi> conſidered in our ſelves. We deſerve all kind of Miſeries, both to be miſerable here, and in the World to come. And ſhould ſuch be <hi>lifting up</hi> themſelves, (<hi>Lucifer</hi>-like) that deſerve to be laid as <hi>low as Hell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, how many are the Miſeries, Afflictions, that the beſt are here ſubject unto? (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19.) And can ſuch be proud of the things of this life, who have deep and ſerious apprehenſions of Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, (beſides divers other ways of their being deprived of any earthly enjoyments?) Shall they be proud of their Eſtates, that know they maybe ſoon blaſted, that know Riches <hi>have wings,</hi> and ſee them ready to take wing and flee away? Or proud of Friends, that know <hi>Men of low degree are vanity, and Men of high degree are a lie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or would ſuch be proud of their Gifts, Graces, Comforts, Experiences, that know how ſhort they come every way, and know that to <hi>grow proud</hi> of any of theſe, is the way to be cut ſhorter?</p>
            <p>Now let us reflect on theſe things, and on our ſelves. Have we this <hi>ſelf-aquaintance?</hi> This is the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:92979:144"/>neceſſary ground-work of Humility. Without it, true Humility can neither be <hi>attained,</hi> nor <hi>maintained.</hi>

Some are brought down in a more gentle way. But obſerve it, the <hi>humble ſpirit</hi> is a <hi>contrite ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. It is true, (as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) a ſenſe of God's tranſcendently glorious, and infinite Perfections, is enough to humble the holy <hi>Angels,</hi> or to keep them <hi>humble:</hi> but to <hi>humble a Sinner,</hi> there muſt be alſo a true ſenſe of his own <hi>ſinful imperfections.</hi> An innocent creature muſt be humble: a guilty <hi>ſinful creature</hi> muſt be <hi>humbled,</hi> as well as <hi>humble;</hi> yea, without being kindly humbled, and brought to loath himſelf for ſin, the ſinfulneſs of his nature and life both; he cannot be humble with <hi>that Humility</hi> which is neceſſary for a ſinner. It is not enough for a ſinful creature to have a ſenſe of his <hi>deficiency,</hi> his wants and imperfections, as he is a <hi>creature;</hi> but ſuch a one muſt alſo have a ſenſe of his <hi>defection</hi> and degeneracy, a ſenſe of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and tranſgreſſions <hi>as a ſinner.</hi> And though it ſeemeth ſcarce to deſerve the <hi>name of Humility,</hi> for a diſloyal, unworthy, ungrateful creature, that has fallen from God to the World, to Sin and Vanity, that has <hi>gone a whoring from God</hi> to follow ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:92979:144"/>for ſuch a one to lye low in <hi>ſelf-abhorrence,</hi> to ſee himſelf to be vile; this I ſay, ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the name of humility; yet is it the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of Chriſtian Humility; yea <hi>a chief part</hi> of our Humility here.</p>
            <p>There is an Humility that ſome learn from their being reduced to a low eſtate in the World. They are fallen into Poverty, Diſgrace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now they do not <hi>look ſo big,</hi> or carry ſo high, as they were wont to do. But know, thy Humility is not right, if it be upon ſuch worldly accounts only, and not upon the account of thy ſins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. True Humility is moſt <hi>inward.</hi> A ſhew of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is not enough. To be <hi>cloathed with Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in the Apoſtle's ſenſe, is more than to wear mean clothes. Though I muſt needs ſay, that an <hi>humble mind,</hi> and a <hi>proud garb,</hi> are things that do not ſuit together. O that they that uſe to <hi>cloak their Pride</hi> with the pretence of <hi>Decency,</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether Humility be not more comely, and would not more commend them in the eyes of God, and all ſober Men! Humility is certainly more <hi>lovely</hi> in its plaineſt, graveſt dreſs, than <hi>ſtinking pride,</hi> with all its painting, patches, powders, though clothed in Purple, and tricked up as fine as fingers can make it. The <hi>ornaments of pride</hi> are a real diſgrace, a ſhame to thoſe that wear them. O but Humility, that is an Ornament indeed, <hi>an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſight of God of great price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then we muſt ſee that we are <hi>humble in God's ſight.</hi> Jam. 4.10. <hi>Humble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> True Humility is <hi>by the ſight,</hi> and knowledg of God, (as before) and is ſuch <hi>in God's ſight;</hi> and not only in appearance to Men. All
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:92979:145"/>Grace as it is from God, ſo it <hi>has reſpect to him.</hi> Herein lieth the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of Grace, that it is what it is <hi>before God,</hi> and not only before Men. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity does not affect making a ſhew. That is <hi>Pride,</hi> which makes one <hi>affect a ſeeming</hi> to be humble. So it is not to be liked, when one affects a ſpeech, or attire different from the moſt grave and ſober, to be counted more humble. Let us look to our hearts. We may not hang out thoſe <hi>flags of Pride,</hi> ſome do; and yet Pride may have full power, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand within. We may appear humble to Men, but are we humble <hi>in the ſight of God?</hi> are we <hi>lowly in heart?</hi> We may have learnt an humble carriage; but are we <hi>humble in ſpirit,</hi> (as Pro. 29.23) or <hi>of an humble ſpirit?</hi> (Iſa. 57.15.)</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) True Humility, as it is Humility of heart, ſo the <hi>heart is really for it. Humbleneſs of mind,</hi> and a mind to be humble, are inſeparable. I had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to touch on this before; yet methinks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſhould be added. As <hi>humiliation,</hi> and ſorrow for ſin, if it be right and kindly, is <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> as the <hi>fear of God,</hi> if it be genuine, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, is <hi>free;</hi> ſo is true <hi>Humility.</hi> Indeed there is a <hi>voluntary Humility,</hi> condemned <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Humility. Like that of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in worſhipping, and <hi>invocating Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it too great boldneſs, to come to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in and through Chriſt, not conſidering how great boldneſs and <hi>preſumption</hi> it is for ſorry ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures to ſet up <hi>other Mediators,</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> with Chriſt, and ſo to come to God in a way that he has not appointed, or allowed. Such may think it great Humility: but rather may we not ſay (with the Apoſtle) they are <hi>vainly puffed up by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:92979:145"/>heir fleſhly mind?</hi> Let Men be never ſo free, and forward in ſuch ſelf-deviſed, <hi>ſeeming humble</hi> wayes of Worſhip, God is not pleaſed with them. And yet our Humility muſt be <hi>voluntary</hi> too, in a <hi>right ſenſe,</hi> or it is not right. We muſt be <hi>willingly vile in our own eyes,</hi> and deſire to be thus more vile, to lie lower in our own thoughts. Some there are, mightily caſt down, and far out of conceit with themſelves, and their own eſtates, looking on themſelves as loſt, and undone. All this may be, and yet no true Humility. There is a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt an awakened, ſtorming Conſcience, and an humble and contrite heart, where the heart is humble, a Man would ſee his ſins, would loath himſelf for them, deſires to lie as low as God would have him. Where the Heart is not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only Conſcience is awakened and terrified, a Man hath no ſuch deſire. His Sins are brought to his remembrance, are <hi>ſet in order before his eyes,</hi> when he has <hi>no will</hi> to ſearch and finde them out.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Humility prepares the Heart to receive and <hi>ſubmit to reproof.</hi> And this is a great ſign of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if we could more patiently bear others admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and reproving us, than hear their vain applauſes, or undue praiſes of us. The Humble would account thoſe enemies to them, who ſhall this way tempt them to proud and high conceits of themſelves: but will acknowledg ſuch their <hi>beſt friends</hi> which help them further to ſee what is amiſs in themſelves to their further humbling.</p>
            <p>But a <hi>Scorner loveth not one that reproves him,</hi> Pro. 15.12. The Proud have their ſtomacks riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, that in great faithfulneſs tell them
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:92979:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their faults.

They care for none but ſuch as have the <hi>knack</hi> to humour and flatter them.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Humility is not for <hi>excuſing,</hi> extenuating Sin, but for a free, ingenuous, and <hi>hearty confeſſion</hi> of it. The proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> had not a word of <hi>confeſſion,</hi> Luk. 18.11. he was all for ſetting forth his own vertues. Though <hi>complementally</hi> he gave God thanks; yet it was really, and <hi>deſignedly</hi> to uſher in his own praiſe. The humble Soul is quite in another <hi>ſtrain,</hi> not for juſtifying himſelf; but ready ſtill to accuſe and condemn himſelf. He neither hides, nor pleads for his Sins: but is willing to ſee them, and ready to acknowledge, and aggravate them: To be <hi>bold in ſinning,</hi> but <hi>aſhamed to confeſs Sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cur te pudet pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum tuum dicere, quem non puduit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> Bern.</note> are ſigns of a graceleſs heart. And to be <hi>quick-ſighted</hi> in ſpying faults &amp; miſcarriages in others, but to <hi>overlook</hi> ones own; and to be forward to aggravate the faults of others, but to make light of ones own miſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, are no ſigns of an humble heart.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Humility would not ſuffer us to be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with <hi>predominant ſelf-conceit.</hi> The humble have low thoughts of themſelves, their Gifts, Abilities, and Performances. The proud are contrary, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing themſelves, thinking highly of themſelves, and of what they do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Humility will not ſuffer one to be conceited of his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Knowledg.</hi> Pro. 26.12. <hi>Seeſt thou a Man wiſe in his own conceit? there is more hope
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:92979:146"/>of a fool than of him.</hi> He is a <hi>proud fool,</hi> and worſe than a <hi>fool,</hi> that is in any meaſure <hi>ſenſible</hi> of his fooliſhneſs, and willing to acknowledg, and to be cured of it. There is <hi>more hope</hi> of ſuch a one, who would be more teachable, more tractable. The humble Soul is more ready to take notice of its darkneſs, its ignorance, than of its knowledge: is very ſenſible of its ſhort-ſightedneſs, and ſees the need it hath to learn. When proud ſpirits, though very ſhallow, think they know enough already. Like <hi>young Scholars,</hi> that when they have got a little ſmattering of Learning, fancy themſelves <hi>taller by the head</hi> than others; when ſeven years more ſpent in diligent ſtudy, might help them to ſee how little they know, how much they are ſtill in the dark. <hi>Novices,</hi> that know leaſt, are commonly moſt <hi>puffed up</hi> with a conceit of their Knowledg. And hence it is, that ſuch are moſt ſubject to fall into errours. They think themſelves <hi>wiſer than their Teachers.</hi> And the conceit they have of their own knowledge, will not bear a contradiction from any, nor ſuffer them to queſtion or ſuſpect their own Opinions, to take things into ſober conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Yet I would not plead for <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to doubt of every thing. Nor would I have Chriſtians deny the knowledg that God hath given them. As Knowledge is <hi>a gift of God,</hi> we ought to reflect on what he hath given, to be thankful for it. And indeed Knowledge in the very <hi>nature of the thing,</hi> is manifeſt to them that have it. You may as well go about to <hi>perſwade a Man out of his ſenſes,</hi> that he does not ſee, or hear, what he ſees and hears; as that he does not know,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:92979:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>what indeed he knoweth. He that is awake, knows he is <hi>awake;</hi> and you cannot make him think that he does but <hi>dream.</hi> He that is <hi>enlightened</hi> with the ſound knowledg of God, and Chriſt, is aſſured of the truth of thoſe things, which were but notions and <hi>fancies</hi> to him before. And it highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſtians to be ſo grounded in the knowledg of the Truth, that they may <hi>hold faſt the profeſſion of it without wavering,</hi> that they may be <hi>ready to give a reaſon of their Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope to any that ſhall ask</hi> and demand it of them; and that it may not be in the power of the moſt learned, and ſubtile Jeſuite, or Sophiſter, to wreſt it from them; and that they may be able to keep their ground, to <hi>ſtand faſt,</hi> though there ſhould be never ſo great and general Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and falling away from the Truth; though they ſhould be cenſured as ſingular proud, and ſelf-conceited, that took themſelves to be wiſer than all the World beſides. It is neither <hi>pride</hi> nor <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,</hi> but <hi>ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> and conſtancy, to <hi>hold faſt known Truth,</hi> though we were left alone, had none about us that would own it, or own us in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it. As was ſaid of <hi>Athanaſius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius contra totum Mundum,</hi> the <hi>whole World againſt Athanaſius, and Athanaſius againſt the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is <hi>Pride,</hi> when one conceiteth himſelf to be knowing, while he is very ignorant. It is Pride, that makes one ſeem to himſelf more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than he is. So alſo when one hath <hi>high thoughts</hi> of, admires himſelf for what he knows, he is <hi>proud, knowning nothing as he ought.</hi> They that know moſt of God, and the things of God, have no ſuch ground to be conceited of themſelves, for what they know; as they have indeed to be humbled,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:92979:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>to bluſh, and be aſhamed, that they know no more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Humility will not ſuffer one to be conceited of his <hi>abilitiy,</hi> and ſufficiency. An humble Soul dares not encounter Temptation in its <hi>own ſtrength,</hi> dares not undertake and ſet upon Duty in its own ſtrength. As <hi>Paul</hi> (though an eminent Apoſtle) ſays of the Work he was called unto, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. And chap. 3.5. <hi>not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> The humble Soul is really ſenſible of its Infirmities and of an abſolute need <hi>of the Spirits aſſiſtance</hi> to help its infirmities, (as Rom. 8.26.) <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-confidence</hi> do not agree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Humility will not ſuffer one to be highly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited</hi> of his <hi>beſt ſervices.</hi> It will teach a Man to have low thoughts of all he does. This takes away the <hi>Grace</hi> of any performance, when a Man is proud of what he has done. Who ſo active for God as <hi>Paul</hi> was? yet he was not puft up with his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but <hi>ſerved the Lord with all humility of mind,</hi> Act. 20.19. He arrogated nothing to himſelf. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. Not I, but Chriſt in me: not I, but the Grace of God with me. And did not his <hi>face ſhine more</hi> for this <hi>veil</hi> on it? And 1 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I thank Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>who hath enabled me.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. he ſpeaks of himſelf, as one that <hi>had obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful,</hi> had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy to do his Duty. The more he was <hi>ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> to do for God, to ſerve God faithfully, the more he ſaw himſelf <hi>obliged</hi> to God's Mercy. Humble
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:92979:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>Souls will acknowledg their own <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to be but as <hi>filthy rags,</hi> (Iſa. 64.6.) As <hi>rags,</hi> that are not ſufficient to <hi>cover</hi> them; as <hi>filthy rags,</hi> that have ſo much ſin in them, as would render them <hi>more pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi> ſtill, if the Lord ſhould behold them with the ſtrict eye of his Juſtice only. The truely humble can ſee <hi>more evil</hi> in their beſt Duties, than natural Men are wont to diſcern in their plain and groſs tranſgreſſions. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had been moſt active for God, yet he ſaw need of <hi>pardoning Grace,</hi> and Mercy: <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this alſo, and ſpare me according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy Mercy. Ita fiduciam ponit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wolph.</note> 
               <hi>non in meritis ſuis, ſed in miſericordia Dei.</hi> Thus Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is oppoſit to <hi>ſelf-conceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">(8.) Humility is oppoſite to a <hi>predominant affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of humane <hi>applauſe,</hi> and vain-glory. It will teach us to ſay (as in Pſal. 115.1.) <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us; but unto thy name give Glory.</hi> The Humble Soul would not <hi>ſet up for it ſelf.</hi>

               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:92979:148"/>for a Creature to act for its own glory; yet it is <hi>utterly unlawful,</hi> plainly croſſing, and contradicting the end for which God made it. He made all things <hi>for himſelf,</hi> and made Man a reaſonable Creature, capable of knowing God, his dependance on, and obligations to his Maker, that he ſhould <hi>actually deſign,</hi> and aim at God's Glory. Now when a Man <hi>acteth for his own Glory,</hi> he ſets up a wrong end, <hi>directly contrary</hi> to the end for which he was made, and <hi>in his Pride lifts up</hi> himſelf againſt God. And how intollerable is that? They that <hi>ſeek honour from Men,</hi> that <hi>do all to be ſeen of Men,</hi> that they may have glory from Men, (with the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) certainly they are far from true Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Pride yet reigneth in them. Take notice how your <hi>Pulſe beats</hi> here. Proud ſpirits are for all the applauſe, and honour they can get. They would be extolled, and cryed up of every one. They think others wrong them, if they do not praiſe, and flatter them. Whereas the Humble are <hi>afraid of undue praiſe</hi> from Men. He dares not allow of any praiſes given him, that would in the leaſt <hi>eclipſe,</hi> or diminiſh the Praiſe, and Glory of God. He is not pleaſed, tickled, but rather diſquieted, ſet a trembling, when he hears himſelf commended, he fears a ſnare in it. He would not that Pride ſhould have any ſuch advantage, and opportunity to lift up its head. A good Man layes this down as a <hi>ſingular act of Humility,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>White</hi> Power of Godlineſs, p. 53.</note> 
               <q>to be <hi>troubled at all undue Praiſes,</hi> as much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are <hi>at unjuſt Slanders.</hi>
               </q> And happy is that ſoul that can find it in it ſelf. This would ſhew an high degree of Humility. But this is no ſign of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:92979:149"/>to be over-fond, or greedy of Mans praiſe. An <hi>habitual exceſſive regard</hi> to Mans approbation, or habitual exceſſive deſire of Mans applauſe, is a plain evidence of prevailing Pride.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) Humility would make us willing, and very well content to <hi>lie low</hi> in the thoughts, and eſteem of others. It would teach one how to paſs through honour, and <hi>diſhonour,</hi> through good report, and <hi>evil report.</hi> The Humble will not be much moved with Mens revilings, as they are not puffed up with the breath of applauſe. Let the <hi>Winds</hi> be never ſo high, and blow which way they will, they have little force on one, that <hi>lieth flat on the ground.</hi> And one that lieth low in his own thoughts, will bear it very well if he perceives that others have low thoughts of him. One that truly <hi>abhors</hi> him ſelf, will not think much to be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> and contemned of others. But when a Man will ſpeak contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of himſelf, of his gifts, and performances, and yet think himſelf wronged, if others do not praiſe him ſomuch the more; when a Man would take it ill, that others ſhould think, and ſpeak as meanly of him, as he will ſpeak of him ſelf; how ever he makes a fair ſhew of Humility, puts on a <hi>cloak of Humility,</hi> yet he has a falſe, and proud ſpirit within.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) Humility will make a Man <hi>content</hi> in and <hi>with his ſtation.</hi> It is contrary to a courſe of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſpiring thoughts, projects, and attempts. Pſal. 131.1. <hi>Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great matters, or in things too high for me.</hi> Pride is the <hi>grand <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> This puts Men upon <hi>invading</hi> thoſe <hi>Offices,</hi> and Employments, which belong not to them,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:92979:149"/>which they are no way fit for. Proud Spirits being ſo conceited of their own abilities and deſerts, think that they are the Men who ſhould be choſen into Offices, and that none are ſo fit to be truſted, or employed, as they. As <hi>Abſolom,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.4. <hi>O that I were made Judg in the Land, that every Man which hath any Suit, or Cauſe, might come unto me,</hi> and <hi>I would do him Juſtice.</hi> He thought he could have ruled better than his Father. The Humble rather complain of unfitneſs for the Work, to which they are called. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid <hi>Who am I that I ſhould go to Pharaoh?</hi> Exod. 3.11. <hi>O my Lord, I am not Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi> chap. 4.10. And <hi>Jeremiah, Ah, Lord God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I cannot ſpeak; for I am a Child.</hi> They that are <hi>lowly minded</hi> are willing to be placed in a <hi>lower ſphere.</hi> I'ts true, if the Lord be pleaſed to exalt them, they may not withſtand him, and his call: But they are not for <hi>exalting themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Humility is ſo contrary to Ambition, that it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> ſubmiſſion to the meaneſt, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt works one is called to. It teacheth to <hi>conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Men of low eſtate,</hi> (Rom. 12.16.) It is for ſtooping to the meaneſt Offices of love, (as Chriſt taught his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.) As <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am not worthy to waſh the feet of the Servants of my Lord.</hi> Servants that are proud, cannot bring their minds to the loweſt work; but would have others under them, to be their drudges. Humble minds are willing to <hi>take their work before</hi> them, would buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle to the meaneſt ſervices, that their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſets them on.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) Humility will teach Moderation, and keep the heart in an <hi>even frame</hi> in various conditions. The Humble are not ſo lifted up (as others) in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:92979:150"/>proſperity. They can be <hi>advanced</hi> in the World, and yet not lifted up in themſelves, but <hi>lowly in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> They are not ſo apt to ſink in Adverſity, or when abaſed in the World. As <hi>Ships</hi> that carry a <hi>low Sail,</hi> are in leſs danger of being <hi>over-ſet</hi> with violent guſts of Wind. Here is a Myſtery, a <hi>Riddle,</hi> a Paradox, to <hi>lie low</hi> in our own thoughts is a good way to prevent <hi>dejection,</hi> being caſt down too much in our Spirits. So</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) Humlity will teach <hi>Patience</hi> in Affliction. The truly humble from the ſenſe they have of their ſinfulneſs, and unworthineſs are oft wondering, that they ſhould enjoy any Mercy, and that they are no more afflicted. They wonder, that they are not <hi>afflicted only, and oppreſſed alway.</hi> They cannot but confeſs, (with <hi>Ezra</hi>) that God <hi>puniſheth leſs than their iniquities deſerve,</hi> (Ezr. 9.13.) The proud are <hi>full of fret,</hi> and ſullen under croſſes, as if they were hardly dealt with. As we read of <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4.5. <hi>his Countenance fell.</hi> When God layes his afflicting hand on them, their Countenances fall. And 'tis from the <hi>height</hi> of their ſpirits, that they cannot bear acroſs. There is a <hi>caſting down</hi> (as Dr.
<note place="margin">Souls confl. p. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Sibs</hi> ſayes) which is not from <q>
                  <hi>Humility,</hi> but <hi>Pride:</hi> when we muſt <hi>have our Wills,</hi> or God ſhall not have a <hi>good look</hi> from us.</q> Many whoſe hearts are ready to <hi>break</hi> under their outward Croſſes, when if they were humble, they would gently ſtoop to them. But it is very grievous to a haughty mind to bow, and buckle to a low condition. Eccl. 7.8. The <hi>patient in ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>proud in ſpirit</hi> are there oppoſed. Impatience is mainly from pride. And till our hearts are <hi>humbled,</hi> we ſhall never <hi>kindly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:92979:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>accept</hi> of the puniſhment of our iniquity. (<hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41.) But the humble Soul takes all patiently, If he be ſick, impoveriſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he will not expoſtulate with God, and ſay, <hi>why am I thus?</hi> but rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that it is no worſe.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) Humility will teach <hi>thankfulneſs.</hi> As the Humble will juſtifie God in all his ſeverity; ſo they cannot but magnifie him for his Mercy. The more humble any one is, the more <hi>thankful.</hi> He will be thankful even for the leaſt of Mercies. As <hi>Jacob</hi> acknowledged, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy mercies,</hi> which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy Servant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10 And how much more will ſuch a one admire the free Grace of God in any his ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours?</p>
            <p>But proud ſpirits are not affected with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, in what he does for them, they look upon all that comes, as due. Yea, when they have much, they can be diſcontented, that they have no more. They are full of murmurings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, as if they were wronged, becauſe they have not all they would have. Pride ſhews it ſelf both in <hi>unthankfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>diſcontent.</hi> The Proud are ever hard to pleaſe. What God does for them, does not pleaſe them. Like many proud ſawcy beggars, who are not pleaſed with an ordinary Alms, count not an ordinary Alms worth thanks.</p>
            <p n="14">(14.) Humility teaches ſouls to pray aright, and makes Souls prayerful. As it is, Prov. 18.23. <hi>The poor uſeth intreaties,</hi> or <hi>ſupplications.</hi> So the humble, and poor in ſpirit. A <hi>poor Man,</hi> and a <hi>Beggar</hi> are terms with us oft uſed promiſcuouſly. Poverty will put Men <hi>upon begging.</hi> The humble, and poor in ſpirit will be much in Prayer, and ſerious, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:92979:151"/>earneſt in Prayer. O, ſuch could not <hi>live without Prayer!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is no coming to God in Prayer, but <hi>upon our knees,</hi> no coming but <hi>in Humility,</hi> in a ſenſe of our wants, and of our unworthineſs. The <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and they <hi>that ſeek God,</hi> are put together in the Promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.32. The Humble will ſeek God. Such will pray and cry to God, and God cannot <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the cry of the Humble,</hi> Pſal. 9.12. He will <hi>hear the deſire of the Humble,</hi> Pſal. 10.17.</p>
            <p n="15">(15.) Humility will teach ſouls to <hi>wait,</hi> as well as pray. It makes the ſoul willing to <hi>wait for an anſwer</hi> in God's way, and time. You account thoſe proud, ſawcy beggars, that are not pleaſed with what you give them, (as was ſaid before) or that will not ſtay, and wait a little, till you are ready to ſerve them. But the Humble will ſay, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, 123.2. <hi>Behold, as the eyes of Servants look unto the hand of their Maſters, and as the eyes of a Maiden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hand of her Miſtreſs: ſo our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</hi> The truly humble know, that God is worthy indeed to be waited on, and that his Mercy is <hi>worth wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for,</hi> and that they (for their parts) deſerve to be kept waiting, and that it is of God's free and abundant Grace, if (after long waiting) Mercy do come in at laſt.</p>
            <p n="16">(16.) Humility cauſeth <hi>reverence</hi> in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the ſoul's approaches unto God. The Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſome good meaſure apprehend an <hi>infinite diſtance</hi> betwixt God and them, they are ſenſible of their unworthineſs, and unfitneſs to have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſo great, and glorious and holy a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.27. <hi>Behold, now I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:92979:151"/>upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, which am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> As <hi>Ezra,</hi> ch. 9.6. <hi>O my God, I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, my God.</hi> As the <hi>Publican,</hi> through the ſenſe of his own vileneſs, was aſhamed to draw nigh to God, and <hi>to lift up his eyes to Heaven,</hi> Luk. 18.13. <hi>ſo likewiſe</hi> the poor, humble, contrite ſpirit attends on the Word with reverence, <hi>trembles at the Word,</hi> Iſa. 66.2.</p>
            <p n="17">(17.) Humility teacheth <hi>Charitableneſs</hi> towards others. The Humble uſe to have more <hi>Charity</hi> for <hi>others,</hi> than for themſelves. They have more to ſay, to extenuate others faults, than they would have to ſay for themſelves. They are for excuſing others, ſo far as they may, while they are ſtrict, and ſevere in judging themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Humble will not <hi>deſpiſe</hi> ſuch as are below them, nor <hi>envy</hi> ſuch as are above them. They are charitable. The proud are ſcornful. From an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high eſteem of themſelves, they come to ſcorn, and contemn others, or are envious, grudging at ſuch as are above them in Place, Eſtate, or Gifts.</p>
            <p n="18">(18.)
<note place="margin">Bern.</note> Humility teacheth <hi>meekneſs. Nimirum collectaneae ſunt humilitas et manſuetudo.</hi> Humility, and Meekneſs are like twins, nouriſhed with the <hi>ſame Milk.</hi> Diverſe of thoſe <hi>conſiderations</hi> that tend to make us humble, alſo tend to <hi>meeken</hi> us. <hi>Humbleneſs of mind,</hi> and <hi>meekneſs</hi> are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. And they go together. As we read of Chriſt, our chief Pattern, and <hi>Examplar,</hi> Mat. 11.29. <hi>I am meek, and lowly in heart.</hi> Proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſe to be very <hi>tutchy.</hi> One ſcarce knows how to ſpeak, how to carry towards ſuch. Proud <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is in great wrath, if <hi>Mordecai</hi> fail in a matter
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:92979:152"/>of Complement. A proud ſpirit is a turbulent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Only by pride cometh contention,</hi> Pro. 13.10. Such are <hi>given to ſtrife,</hi> Pro. 28.25. We read of the <hi>wrath of pride,</hi> Pro. 21.24. But the humble will be of a patient, quiet, calm, and peaceable ſpirit. Not eaſily <hi>provoked,</hi> and ſoon <hi>pacified.</hi> When the proud are eaſily provoked, a ſmall matter will move, and irritate them: but they are hardly reconciled, not pacified without great ſubmiſſion, without very much ado.</p>
            <p>Only here muſt be ſome <hi>allowance</hi> for humane frailty, where the natural temper, and <hi>conſtitution</hi> is <hi>cholerick, &amp;c.</hi> where there is the Grace of Humility, and ſo Meekneſs in truth. It will not appear ſo fair in one, that is naturally of a rugged, and boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temper. It requires more Grace to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and <hi>tame a fierce</hi> diſpoſition. Yet Grace, where it is, will be ſtriving againſt the <hi>ſtream</hi> of natural headſtrong Paſſions; though it be oft born down by them.</p>
            <p n="19">(19.) Humility will teach us, as to be ſenſible of, and ſorry for our own ſpiritual weakneſſes, and ſinful imperfections; ſo likewiſe to be pleaſed with, to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the greater abilities, more ſhining and flouriſhing Graces, and comfortable enlargements of others. The humble Soul is glad, while he is <hi>weak,</hi> yet that others are <hi>ſtrong;</hi> while he can do but little, yet that others are full of activity for God; while he (alas!) drives on but heavily, yet that there are others, whoſe <hi>hearts are lifted up</hi> in God's wayes, who are following hard after God.</p>
            <p>The Proud are not well pleaſed, to ſee others go before them. They are ill affected towards thoſe, that by out ſhining, ſeem to obſcure, and eclipſe them.</p>
            <pb n="287" facs="tcp:92979:152"/>
            <p>The Humble will not repine, but rejoyce at others comforts, and enlargements. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.2. <hi>My ſoul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord: the humble ſhall hear thereof, and be glad.</hi> Pſal. 69.30, 32. I <hi>will praiſe the name of God</hi> with a Song, and <hi>will magnifie him</hi> with thankſgiving. <hi>The humble ſhall ſee this, and be glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">(20.) Humility cauſeth <hi>tractableneſs,</hi> makes one of a yielding temper. The humble ſpirit is an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſpirit. Such a one trembles at the Word, (as before) is awed with the authority of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. The humble is not for <hi>diſputing</hi> but <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a proud ſpirit is a froward, ſtubborn ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The proud are ſet upon their own wills, how croſs ſoever to the will of God. Neh. 9.16. <hi>But they and our Fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy Commandments.</hi> And again, v. 29. <hi>Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy Commandments.</hi> Jer. 13.15. <hi>Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud.</hi> Intimating, that while Men are proud, they will not regard God ſpeaking to them, will not heed God commanding. So v. 17. <hi>If ye will not hear, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride.</hi> It is from <hi>pride</hi> of ſpirit, that Men <hi>will not hear,</hi> will not obey. The <hi>proud Men</hi> did not ſtick to give the Prophet the lie, they told him to his face, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt falſly,</hi> when he came with God's Meſſage, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.1, 2.</p>
            <p n="21">(21.) Humility will prepare, and make one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to bear <hi>reproach</hi> and contempt <hi>for Chriſt.</hi> It is a light thing to an humble ſpirit to be vilified for Chriſt. They that are <hi>vile in their own eyes,</hi> will not think much to be vile in Mens eyes, eſpecially
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:92979:153"/>when it is <hi>for the Lord,</hi> and their tender reſpect to his Will and Honour. If for their high eſteem of him, and his Service, they be <hi>counted as the filth of the World,</hi> and <hi>off-ſcouring of all things,</hi> they can be very well content.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Spernere mundum, ſpernere nullum, ſpernere ſeſe,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Spernere ſe ſperni</hi> —</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>four things</hi> that make an <hi>happy</hi> Man, agree to, and meet in the <hi>Humble.</hi> He <hi>contemns the World,</hi> he <hi>contemns none,</hi> he <hi>contemns himſelf,</hi> he <hi>contemns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contemned,</hi> eſpecially when he is contemned of others for his honouring the Lord. The Humble is little concerned about <hi>vindicating</hi> his own name, while he is much concerned for the Honour of God. When he ſeeks to wipe off any foul and falſe charge laid on himſelf, to clear his own innocency; yet it is not ſo much with <hi>reſpect to himſelf,</hi> and his own credit, as with reſpect to the reputation of Religion, with reſpect to the Honour of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and to the intereſt of the Goſpel, that theſe may not ſuffer in and with him. To be laid <hi>under ſlanders,</hi> ſuch as tend to the diſcredit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of his holy Profeſſion, this he could not but account an heavy. Croſs, and Affliction: but otherwiſe to be <hi>reproached for Chriſt's</hi> ſake, and the Goſpel, he would account an honour to him. As they rejoyced, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. that they were ſo far <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,</hi> as to <hi>ſuffer ſhame</hi> for his Name.</p>
            <p>But proud ſpirits are for ſetting off themſelves, and making a ſhew in the World. And no longer for Religion, or for no more of it than may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to Men, than will ſtand with their
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:92979:153"/>height, repute and eſteem in the World. They that <hi>ſeek honour from Men,</hi> will hardly be brought to own diſgraced Truths, and reproached Duties.</p>
            <p n="22">(22.) Humility will cauſe an <hi>abhorrence of Pride,</hi> eſpecially in our ſelves. The truly humble cannot like Pride in any, but deteſt it moſt in themſelves. I do not ſay, that the humble are free from all <hi>riſings of Pride;</hi> but ſuch do more eaſily, and clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, and ſo make any <hi>riſings of Pride</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their further humbling. As we read of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.26. <hi>He humbled himſelf for the pride (the lifting up) of his heart.</hi> When his heart was mounting up in Pride, he ſoon obſerved the <hi>motion</hi> of it, and quickly pluckt it down again. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no Grace ſo perfect in the Saints here; but ſome remainders of the contrary corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſtill found in them. The moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are not free from all ſtirrings of pride. As one has the compariſon, Pride is like <hi>Miſletoe,</hi> that will grow on any Tree. But as I may ſay, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſo far even with it, that as <hi>Pride</hi> will <hi>take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> from a Chriſtians Graces, and Services, to lift up, and ſhew it ſelf; ſo Humility comes on it with a <hi>back-blow,</hi> and takes occaſion to exerciſe it ſelf, upon the very <hi>motions of Pride.</hi> As Pride oft-times <hi>buddeth</hi> upon the flouriſhing acts and exerciſe of Grace: ſo Humility is oft <hi>ſpringing,</hi> when in other reſpects it is <hi>Winter</hi> with the Soul. As in <hi>Winter</hi> Trees <hi>grow at the root.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as by the help of Grace, we come to a plainer diſcovery of, and greater diſpliſance againſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: ſo in this particular, by Humility we are made more aware of Pride, and heartliy engaged againſt it. You may take this for a <hi>Rule,</hi> where
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:92979:154"/>Pride is <hi>leaſt felt,</hi> where it is not diſcerned, there it <hi>moſt prevails. Sicut macula quanto magis creſcit in Oculo, tanto minus videt Homo; ſic ſuperbia quanto major fuerit, tanto minus percipitur.</hi> As a <hi>Pearl in the Eye,</hi> the more it ſpreads, the leſs a Man ſees; ſo the more Pride prevails, the leſs it is ſeen. But true Humility will help one ordinarily to take notice of proud Thoughts, as they ariſe, and cauſe him thereupon to lie lower in <hi>Self-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

As if he had ſaid, <hi>Theſe things I muſt needs tell you, Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will come after me, let him deny himſelf.</hi>— He was <hi>full of this Matter,</hi> and his Spirit within him conſtrained him. He was <hi>preſſed in Spirit,</hi> till he had delivered his Mind here, the Matter was of ſuch weight and moment. As it was with the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 20.9. <hi>The Word in his heart, was as a burning fire in his bones:</hi> He could not keep it in.</p>
            <p>He called the <hi>People</hi> unto him, with his <hi>Diſciples</hi> alſo. Here was a <hi>Leſſon for all</hi> ſorts to learn, and practiſe. A Leſſon for <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> both; for all ranks and conditions of Men. Whoſoever would be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> indeed, muſt <hi>deny himſelf.</hi> Here none are exempted. And this is one of the <hi>firſt Leſſons</hi> a Chriſtian muſt learn. With the <hi>Old Philoſophers,</hi> that follow <hi>Ariſtotle, Privation</hi> is one principle of Generation. <hi>Self-abnegation</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a <hi>neceſſary Principle</hi> of Chriſtianity; yea, Self-denial is a main <hi>conſtitutive part</hi> of it. This is one of the ſpecial <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Society.</hi> As <hi>Colledges</hi> have their <hi>Statutes,</hi> and other Companies and Societies their particular <hi>Orders:</hi> This is an <hi>Order</hi> for all that are of <hi>Chriſt's School.</hi> And without <hi>renouncing Self,</hi> we cannot rightly depend on Chriſt; <hi>without forſaking Self,</hi> we cannot follow Chriſt; <hi>without croſſing Self,</hi> we cannot comply with the Will of Chriſt; <hi>without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ſelf,</hi> we cannot be ready to confeſs Chriſt; we cannot be willing and prepared to die, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Chriſt. How eaſily are Men brought to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Faith,</hi> and Truth, to deny God, and Jeſus
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:92979:155"/>Chriſt, that have not learnt to <hi>deny themſelves?</hi> Will Lovers of themſelves, will Self-ſeekers, ſtick to Chriſt, and his Truth, when put upon trial, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed they are content to <hi>ſell all for the Pearl of price?</hi> Whether they can forſake all for Chriſt? When the Croſs ſhall follow thoſe, that follow Chriſt, will not ſuch flinch from him then? Yea, before any ſuch Trials come, all that have not learnt to <hi>deny themſelves,</hi> have <hi>denied God,</hi> and Chriſt already in <hi>their Hearts,</hi> and are daily denying him in their Works, and Lives. Though Men have a <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> yet while they <hi>deny the power</hi> thereof, ſo far they deny God. And to <hi>deny the power</hi> of Godlineſs, is a ſad preparation and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction</hi> to the groſſeſt, and moſt ſhameful denial of God and Chriſt, when a Temptation thereunto ſhall come.</p>
            <p>No wonder therefore that Chriſt ſays here, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>let him utterly deny himſelf.</hi> The <hi>ſimple Verb</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is as much as to <hi>deny;</hi> that with this Prepoſition added, it ſeems to ſignifie more, to deny with an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> to deny with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and abhorrence of ones ſelf.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what is it to deny our ſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> [1.] In the <hi>Negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We muſt not deny our ſelves to be what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are, as we muſt not <hi>feign</hi> our ſelves to be what we are not. As the Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> ſaid to the diſguiſed Wife of <hi>Jeroboam, Why feigneſt thou thy ſelf to be another?</hi> It is one thing to <hi>diſguiſe,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>deny</hi> our ſelves. The <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> that ſeems to be what he is not, and would not appear to be what he is, is yet far from that <hi>Self-denial,</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:92979:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>calls us to; he deceives himſelf and others, while he does not deny himſelf. So likewiſe, many a ſenſleſs Sinner, when admoniſhed of his Faults, will not acknowledg that <hi>he is the Man</hi> whom ſuch a repoof concerns. He will <hi>juſtifie</hi> himſelf, <hi>though his Lips prove him perverſe;</hi> and though it may further provoke the Lord to plead with him (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.35.) To <hi>deny the Truth</hi> here, is quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to <hi>Self-denial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Some there are in another <hi>Extream.</hi> For whom God hath done much, yet being clouded with <hi>Melancholy,</hi> &amp;c. they cannot ſee ſo clear as otherwiſe they might; and thereupon ſoon que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, yea, <hi>deny any good</hi> wrought in them. The condition of theſe is far better, than the others ſpoken of before: Yet they are to be pittied, and ſuch an <hi>Humour</hi> not to be fed, or encouraged. It is one thing to <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> and another to <hi>deny God's goodneſs</hi> to us. It is no way contrary to Self-denial, for a Chriſtian to ſay (with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.) <hi>By the Grace of God, I am what I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some go further yet, and charge themſelves more deeply, than there is juſt cauſe. As ſome poor troubled Spirits will not down with it, but that they have ſinned the unpardonable Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But though we are not to <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> we are not <hi>falſly to accuſe</hi> our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We are not to <hi>deny our ſelves</hi> in that <hi>ſenſe,</hi> wherein it is ſaid, that <hi>God cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.13. <hi>He abideth faithful;</hi> he cannot deny himſelf. He is ever <hi>as good as his Promiſe,</hi> conſtant to his Word. We may not in this ſenſe deny our ſelves, may not go back from <hi>lawful promiſes</hi> made
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:92979:156"/>either to God, or Men. We ſhould not uſe <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, and nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) We are not to <hi>renounce the uſe of our Reaſon.</hi> That is no <hi>piece of Self-denial</hi> intended, or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red here. That would be to make the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>unreaſonable:</hi> And how great a reproach would that caſt upon Religion? What is Man, but <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal rationale,</hi> or <hi>Ens ratione praeditum,</hi> a Creature endued with Reaſon? That it is as <hi>natural</hi> to him, as <hi>congruous</hi> to that <hi>form,</hi> and kind of being, which his Creator has given him, that he ſhould <hi>uſe his Reaſon,</hi> as that the Sun, Moon, and Stars ſhould ſhine, and give forth their light. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the higheſt, and <hi>nobleſt uſe</hi> our Reaſon ſerves for, to help us in the <hi>diſcovery of Truth,</hi> and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in the <hi>choice of Good.</hi> Therefore no doubt, we may be the <hi>Servants of Chriſt</hi> upon more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms, than <hi>Nahaſh</hi> would have put upon the Men of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead.</hi> Chriſt never required his Followers (in this <hi>ſenſe</hi>) to <hi>put out their right Eyes:</hi> (though we muſt part with our deareſt Luſts, which have been as <hi>our right Eyes,</hi> yet when theſe are pluckt out, we ſhould <hi>ſee never the worſe).</hi> But it is the <hi>way of Antichriſt,</hi> to perſwade Man to an <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> and to <hi>blind Obedience.</hi> It is the drift and deſign of the <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> to get Men <hi>hood-winkt,</hi> that they may be content to <hi>ſee with the Eyes</hi> of their Rulers and Leaders, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them which way they pleaſe. But we ſhould be ready <hi>always to give an anſwer to every Man that asketh us a Reaſon of our Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. And can we <hi>give a Reaſon</hi> of our Faith, without <hi>uſing our Reaſon?</hi> And how oft doth the Lord <hi>reaſon</hi> with Men about Matters of Religion? See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. from
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:92979:156"/>
               <hi>ver.</hi> 5. to <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Then, would he not have Men <hi>uſe their Reaſon</hi> here? Yea, how does he upbraid Men, that they uſed their Reaſon no better, that they did not ſhew <hi>themſelves Men?</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.19. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.11. <hi>It is a People of no underſtanding.</hi> And it is plain, the Scriptures, that are <hi>a Rule</hi> for our Faith and Practice, could not be <hi>rightly applied</hi> and made uſe of, without putting forth our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29, 31, 32. Where Chriſt telleth the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> that denied the Reſurrection, <hi>[Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures.]</hi> No Man could diſcover the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Dead, in that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> brought for it, without the uſe and <hi>exerciſe of Reaſon.</hi> And farther, We muſt have Reaſon to convince thoſe, who as yet believe not the Divine Original, and Authority of the Scriptures. How elſe ſhould Heathens, Infidels be convinced, and converted? Would we have them change their Way, and Opinions, without ſeeing <hi>any Reaſon</hi> for it? And while Hereticks, and Men of unſound Minds <hi>abuſe their Reaſon,</hi> ſetting it againſt the Truth, ſhould not we uſe, and improve our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in defence of the Truth? Can we <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>confute Gain-ſayers,</hi> without uſing our Reaſon? And the Apoſtle would have Chriſtians, not as <hi>Children,</hi> but <hi>Men in underſtanding,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.20. And that is a weighty paſſage, which ſome have laid down, who have written to good purpoſe, [Of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current judgment of Proteſtants,</hi> concerning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Reaſon in matters of Religion.]</hi>

For <hi>Grace work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> on Man, <hi>as Man:</hi> That is, as a rational free Agent, whoſe <hi>Will</hi> muſt be <hi>guided</hi> by the light of his <hi>underſtanding.</hi>
               </q> So they.</p>
            <p>And yet we muſt ſay, that there are <hi>many Points in Religion,</hi> which Mans Reaſon, without Divine <hi>Supernatural</hi> Revelation, could never diſcover; as (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) the Myſtery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though part of the Chriſtian Religion be evident by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> yet what is not of <hi>Natural Revelation,</hi> the ſoundeſt and ſtrongeſt Reaſon and Underſtanding of Man could never reach unto, without the help of <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Revelation. As there is no <hi>ſeeing</hi> without <hi>Light,</hi> ſo there is no <hi>Knowledge</hi> without ſome <hi>intelligible Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, This we muſt not hold, That what is <hi>Supernaturally</hi> revealed, though in it ſelf never ſo much <hi>above</hi> the reach of Natural Reaſon, is not to be doubted of, but muſt be concluded infallibly certain. <q>Though we may not take any thing to be the Word of God <hi>without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxt. <hi>of Self-denial.</hi> pag. 280.</note> yet when we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to take it to be his Word, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and ſubmit to all that is in it, <hi>without any more reaſon</hi> for our Belief.</q> Since it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by many <hi>Infallible proofs,</hi> that the Scriptures are the Word of God, the God of Truth that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Lye, we have <hi>good reaſon</hi> indeed to yield our ready and full aſſent to whatſoever is taught, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:92979:157"/>held forth in the Sacred Scriptures. And it is <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> not to believe the Word of God, that God who is Omniſcient, and All-wiſe, that he <hi>cannot be deceived;</hi> and who is infinitely Holy, and Good, that he <hi>cannot deceive.</hi> Thus thoſe high Points of Faith which could never be cleared by <hi>natural proof,</hi> or evidence; yet we are to receive as <hi>unqueſtionable Verities,</hi> upon account of God's <hi>Veracity,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed by him in his holy Word. In ſuch caſes, to acknowledg the <hi>ſhort-ſightedneſs</hi> of our imperfect underſtandings, is but <hi>reaſonable:</hi> But to deny, or queſtion the truth of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> is moſt <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> and <hi>impious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet it muſt be noted, That this no way <hi>befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> thoſe, who would impoſe <hi>new Articles</hi> of Faith upon Chriſtians, or put a falſe ſenſe on any part of Scripture, that it may be thought to favour their Errors, and Abſurdities. Such are like the <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> of old, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.7.) that would tell the People, <hi>The Lord ſaith it, albeit he had not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> Thus the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would father the firſt-born of Monſters, and groſſeſt of Abſurdities, their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> upon God, and Jeſus Chriſt. A Doctrine full of Contradictions, contrary to common Senſe and Reaſon, and to many plain points of Faith. But from what <hi>Scripture</hi> do they learn, or can they prove it, that a Prieſt hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by mumbling over a few words, to <hi>turn Bread and Wine</hi> into the very <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt?</hi> It's true, we read, <hi>[This is my Body:]</hi> And ſo it is <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> and Repreſentatively, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is <hi>naturally</hi> Bread ſtill. And how oft is it called <hi>Bread,</hi> even <hi>after Conſecration?</hi> (ſhewing that its <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is not <hi>changed</hi> by its Conſecration, but
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:92979:158"/>only its <hi>uſe:</hi>) It is <hi>Bread</hi> ſtill, when Conſecrated, when Adminiſtred, when <hi>Eaten,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26, 27, 28. <hi>As often us ye eat this Bread,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> contrary to plain Scripture, and to all our Senſes, will needs have it to be <hi>no more Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more muſt be laid down here, that Man's <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and underſtanding Faculty, ſince the Fall, is <hi>naturally</hi> blind, and dark, <hi>depraved,</hi> whence it is apt to judg ſiniſterly and falſly of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, unable <hi>ſpiritually</hi> and ſavingly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern them, without the <hi>ſpecial Illumination</hi> of the holy Spirit. Yet it will not follow, that Men muſt <hi>lay aſide their Reaſon,</hi> either waiting for <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations,</hi> (with the <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi>) or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to the <hi>dictates</hi> of Men, hand over head, right or wrong, true or falſe, (with the <hi>Papiſts).</hi> But they are to <hi>uſe their</hi> own <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings</hi> the beſt they can, to get <hi>Inſtruction</hi> from the Word of God, which was written to <hi>make wiſe the Simple,</hi> not <hi>leaning to their own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings,</hi> (which are ſo lame) but earneſtly calling in the help and <hi>guidance</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of Truth, to lead them into all Truth.</hi> And they are in the moſt hopeful way to find the <hi>Spirit's aſſiſtance</hi> here, who are moſt diligent and careful in the <hi>uſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>means,</hi> whereunto he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects Men; ſuch as Reading, Hearing the Word, Meditation, Prayer, Conference.

The <hi>Object,</hi> to be ſeen. 3. The <hi>Light</hi> to irradiate the Object. So to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Religion, and the Doctrine of Salvation; theſe three things are no leſs neceſſarily concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: 1.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:92979:158"/>2. The <hi>Object,</hi> or Doctrine of Truth to be known. 3.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nam et oculus ſic factus eſt, ut videre lumen poſſit, ſed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere non poteſt, niſi ſe illi lumen infuderit.</hi> Fulgent. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 6.</note> That the holy <hi>Spirits's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning</hi> the Mind, or opening the Underſtanding to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and diſcern this Object.

            <p>Pardon this <hi>Digreſſion.</hi> For ſeveral Reaſons I have thought it not <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> at this time to ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>Intereſt of Reaſon</hi> in the matters of Religion. (Concerning which for ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Satisfaction, peruſe thoſe few ſheets forecited.) But thus, that <hi>denying of our ſelves,</hi> which Chriſt calleth us unto, doth not include a <hi>renouncing of the uſe of Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) When we are required to deny our ſelves, the meaning is not, that we ſhould <hi>deſtroy our ſelves,</hi> or <hi>unneceſſarily</hi> do any thing <hi>tending</hi> thereunto. <hi>Self-denial</hi> is an eminent and precious Grace; but <hi>Self-murder</hi> a very great and dreadful Sin. To be ready to <hi>lay down our lives,</hi> when God calleth to it, is an <hi>eminent act</hi> of Self-denial: but to caſt away our lives in a <hi>diſcontened humour,</hi> or by neglect, is quite another thing.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) To <hi>wrong our ſelves,</hi> by denying our ſelves the needful comforts God alloweth us, is not Chriſtian Self-denial. As ſome poor melancholy perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt famiſh themſelves. To deny our ſelves a ſober, moderate uſe of Creature-comforts that we have need of, is more than the Lord requires. Some there are ſo covetous, that though they <hi>have great Wealth</hi> and Riches, yet they <hi>have not power to eat thereof.</hi> Here is <hi>Self-denial</hi> even from the baſeſt <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> A denying of <hi>natural ſelf</hi> for <hi>worldly ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="300" facs="tcp:92979:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But the greateſt wronging of our ſelves is a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi> Grace offered. This is <hi>Self-undoing,</hi> not right Self-denial.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) The <hi>voluntary Poverty</hi> of <hi>Popiſh Votaries</hi> is far different from Chriſtian <hi>Self-denial.</hi> The <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Monks,</hi> that place a great part of <hi>Perfection</hi> in renouncing Eſtates, and worldly Properties, in a <hi>voluntary Poverty,</hi> remember not, or regard not the <hi>words of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> (Act. 20.35.) <hi>that it is more bleſſed to give than to receive.</hi> It's true, when Chriſt calleth us <hi>to ſell,</hi> and part with <hi>all</hi> we have in the World, <hi>and follow him,</hi> we may not <hi>conſult with fleſh and blood</hi> in this caſe, but let all go. But otherwiſe Poverty <hi>in it ſelf</hi> is a puniſhment. It is one of the <hi>Curſes</hi> threatned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.43, 44, 48. Therefore not a thing to be choſen, not to be <hi>vowed.</hi> Sure it is <hi>no perfection,</hi> for Men to <hi>curſe themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's true, if God bring us to poverty, we ought to ſubmit, and bear it patiently. But Men ſhould not caſt away Eſtates, which are an outward <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> which Man ſhould improve to the Honour of God, and good of others. But I need not enlarge here. We are generally for <hi>holding Eſtates</hi> too faſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would the <hi>Popiſh-Votaries</hi> probably ſo readily part with theirs; but that they need not fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any great <hi>loſers by the bargain,</hi> by this <hi>device</hi> living free from care, on others labours, and having ſtill enough <hi>in common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) So their Prieſts muſt all <hi>abſtain frrom Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> and <hi>vow a Single life,</hi> and this they account a meritorious piece of <hi>Self-denial.</hi> But this is not the Self-denial which Chriſt here calleth his followers unto. It were well if they that for magnifie <hi>a Single life,</hi> as a point of high <hi>Perfection</hi> in them, were
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:92979:159"/>as careful to <hi>abſtain from Fornication,</hi> which God hath forbidden, as from <hi>Marriage,</hi> which not God, but the <hi>Romiſh Synagogue</hi> (the <hi>Mother of Harlots</hi>) forbids. But alas! is not <hi>Fornication</hi> a leſs ſin with them, than for a <hi>Prieſt to marry?</hi> yet the Scripture preſcribes <hi>Marriage,</hi> as a <hi>remedy againſt Fornication,</hi> (1 Cor. 7.2, 9.) not their <hi>Vow of ſingle life.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſly allows <hi>a Biſhop,</hi> as alſo a <hi>Deacon,</hi> to have a Wife, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 12. And further, it calls that a <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1, 3. which they make a <hi>Doctrine of Perfection.</hi> Euſebius (in Eccl.

            </p>
            <p n="8">(8.) And their <hi>Monaſtick,</hi> or ſolatary life hath as little true <hi>Self-denial</hi> in it. The <hi>Romiſh Monks</hi> are cloyſtered up, living like <hi>Drones in the Hive</hi> upon the <hi>ſweat of others Labours,</hi> while they may take themſelves to be excuſed from any Calling or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, under this <hi>fine pretence</hi> of <hi>devoting</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>unto Faſting and Prayer.</hi> Indeed <hi>faſting</hi> would be very proper for ſuch <hi>Idle Bellies:</hi> but another kind of faſting. As the Apoſtle commanded, 2 Theſ. 3.10. that if <hi>any would not work, neither ſhould he eat.</hi> Though it is true, God requires not hand-labour of all. There is working with the Head, as well as with the Hands.</p>
            <p>Other particulars I paſs by; only adding this
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:92979:160"/>
               <hi>general,</hi> that we are not required to <hi>deny our ſelves</hi> in any thing, that would be to our ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantage, that would be really injurious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our ſelves in: but where it would be <hi>really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial</hi> to us, where the loſs would be made up in better things than thoſe whereof we are to deny our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But all this while I have not told you, what Self-denial is. Therefore</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] To ſhew <hi>poſitively</hi> what it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> It was Man's <hi>undoing,</hi> when he would be <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up for himſelf,</hi> (as it was the <hi>Prodigals,</hi> Luk. 15.12, 13.) His affecting an <hi>happineſs in himſelf,</hi> and in the creature, ſeparate from God, contrary to the will of God, made him miſerable: when he forgot his <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> on God, and would not be under his <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or at his <hi>diſpoſe,</hi> but would follow his own will, and appetite, would be <hi>carving for himſelf;</hi> then he loſt God, and loſt himſelf, indeed <hi>went beſides himſelf.</hi> Now when ſuch a ſinful degenerate creature is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and <hi>comes to himſelf</hi> again, he ſees the errour of ſuch a courſe, he can no longer reſt, or <hi>center in himſelf,</hi> he goes out of himſelf to God, to depend wholly upon him, to be ruled, and diſpoſed of by him. Thus he <hi>denies himſelf,</hi> and owns God again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let a Man deny himſelf</hi> (as one paraphraſeth on it) <q>let him lay aſide his own <hi>wiſdom</hi> as an <hi>empty Lamp,</hi> his own <hi>will</hi> as an <hi>evil Commander,</hi> his own <hi>imaginations</hi> as a <hi>falſe Rule,</hi> his own <hi>affections</hi> as <hi>corrupt Counſellours,</hi> and his own <hi>ends</hi> as baſe <hi>unworthy marks</hi> to be aimed at.</q>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> fol. p. 120.</note> Thus <hi>Self-denial</hi> is the ſame with <hi>Converſion,</hi> or very near a-kind. Converſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:92979:160"/>by the <hi>term from which</hi> a ſinner turneth., As <hi>Converſion</hi> in ſhort is a <hi>ſinners turning from himſelf to God.</hi> Only whereas we commonly uſe the term, <hi>Converſion,</hi> for the <hi>firſt ſaving change</hi> wrought in a Sinner; <hi>Self-denial</hi> alſo ſignifies, and takes in that <hi>continued holy habit,</hi> with the <hi>ſubſequent acts</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, whereby a Chriſtian demeaneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not as his own, <hi>ſui juris,</hi> but <hi>as the Lord's, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to himſelf,</hi> but <hi>to the Lord.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi> are very near a-kind. <hi>Self-denial</hi> neceſſarily includes <hi>a denying of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and worldly luſts, a crucifying the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof, a crucifying the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a very large, and <hi>comprehenſive duty,</hi> to deny our ſelves. Bear with me, if to make it plainer I uſe many words in deſcribing it. Thus I take it: To <hi>deny our ſelves</hi> is in a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our own <hi>vileneſs</hi> to <hi>abhor,</hi> and condemn our ſelves; and in a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our own <hi>weakneſs</hi> and inſufficiency, not to <hi>depend</hi> on our ſelves, but to abandon <hi>ſelf-confidence;</hi> and in a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our own <hi>unworthineſs,</hi> not to challenge any reward of God, as of <hi>proper debt,</hi> but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg all he does for us to be of his free Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and in a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our <hi>dependance</hi> on God, and <hi>obligations</hi> to him, not to be for <hi>ſeeking,</hi> ſerving, <hi>pleaſing</hi> our ſelves, not to <hi>live to our ſelves,</hi> but unto God, giving up our ſelves, with all we have, to be at his <hi>Service,</hi> at his <hi>Command,</hi> at his <hi>Diſpoſe. Self-denial</hi> is not without <hi>ſelf-reſignation</hi> unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> According to the deſcription here given.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Self-denial is partly in the <hi>Judgment.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Self-denial, as in the <hi>Judgment,</hi> is a ſerious <hi>account,</hi> and full concluding, that we are not <hi>our own,</hi> but the Lords. That God is our <hi>abſolute Owner,</hi>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:92979:161"/>Ruler, Governour. That <hi>ſelf-will</hi> muſt not be out <hi>rule,</hi> nor <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> our <hi>end.</hi> That we ought ever to be at his command, and diſpoſe, <hi>whoſe we are,</hi> to ſeek his Honour and Glory above all things, and to deſire that he may be magnified in us, and by us, whether it be by life, or by death.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Self-denial, as in the <hi>Judgment,</hi> is a clear apprehenſion, a deep <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our own <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and inſufficiency. That we <hi>can do nothing of our ſelves; That the way of Man is not in himſelf, neither is it in him that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi> That we are nothing, <hi>can do nothing, ſeparate</hi> from God, and Chriſt. That we are unable to perform any Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to improve any Ordinance, to uſe any Mercy, to bear any Croſs, to withſtand any Temptation, to maſter and mortifie any Corruption, to act any Grace without him. Yea, that we have ſuch a neceſſary, and <hi>abſolute dependance</hi> on God, that we cannot <hi>live,</hi> or <hi>move,</hi> or <hi>act naturally</hi> without him. That we <hi>ought to ſay</hi> (as Jam. 4.15.) <hi>If the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this, or that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Self-denial, as in the <hi>Judgment,</hi> is a deep ſenſe, and thorough <hi>conviction</hi> of our own <hi>unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and wretched vileneſs. That we of our ſelves deſerve nothing: but are <hi>leſs than the leaſt of Mercies.</hi> That <hi>to us belongeth nothing but ſhame, and confuſion of face.</hi> That when we have done our beſt, have done all we can, we <hi>deſerve not ſo much as thanks</hi> (Luk. 17.10.) That what ever God does for us is of his free Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Self-denial is more eſpecially in the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When a Mans <hi>Will is ſet</hi> for the utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and <hi>rejecting of carnal</hi> and corrupt <hi>Self.</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:92979:161"/>When he is in good earneſt for <hi>caſting off the Old-Man, which is corrupt, with its deceitful Luſts.</hi> When he would no more be <hi>ruled</hi> by the <hi>Law in his Members,</hi> or live, and <hi>walk after the Fleſh:</hi> As the Lord is is ſaid to <hi>deny,</hi> and <hi>not to know</hi> Men, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and condemns, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33.) As a Man renounceth, repudiates a diſloyal adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wife: As a Father is provoked to diſown, caſt off a rebellious Son. This is a <hi>main part of Self-denial,</hi> when we are for caſhiering our Luſts, for <hi>plucking out Right Eyes,</hi> and <hi>cutting off Right Hands,</hi> when we would have no more to do with <hi>our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols.</hi> So long as we are under the <hi>dominion</hi> of any Luſt, till ſuch time as the Will is reſolvedly ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin; ſo long as we are <hi>ſetting up Self</hi> as <hi>Lord,</hi> and our own <hi>Wills,</hi> as our <hi>Law,</hi> in a way of contradiction unto God, our <hi>Soveraign Lord,</hi> and to his holy Will. And thus to <hi>deny God</hi> indeed, inſtead of denying our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it is a Man's hearty deſire in all things to be <hi>ſubject to God's Will,</hi> and Command: <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> That is a Self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, which is willing to do as God would have it. <hi>[Let a Man deny himſelf]</hi> that is, (ſay ſome) deny his <hi>own will,</hi> ſo far as it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonant to God's Will; that is to deny our ſelves; to be more for doing God's Will, than our own. When we had rather pleaſe and ſerve God, than pleaſe, or ſerve our ſelves. When we are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, <hi>our Pattern,</hi> John 5.30. <hi>I ſeek not my own Will, but the Will of the Father that hath ſent me.</hi> When it is pleaſing to us to croſs our ſelves, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Will of God. When we deſire to deny our own Eaſe, Profit, Intereſt, to promote
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:92979:162"/>God's Intereſt, and to do him ſervice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When it is a Mans hearty deſire, as to be <hi>ſubject</hi> to God's <hi>Preceptive Will,</hi> ſo to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to his <hi>Providential</hi> and Diſpoſing <hi>Will.</hi> When a Man can ſay from his Heart, <hi>Whatever I ſuffer, the Will of the Lord be done.</hi> When he deſires rather to ſubmit to the Will of God, than to have his own will. This is to deny our ſelves, to be willing that God ſhould <hi>chuſe our Inheritance for us;</hi> that he ſhould carve for us, rather than to be left to our own Carving; to be willing to put our ſelves, with all we have into his Hands; that he ſhould have the ordering of us, of our conditions, and all our concerns, that he ſhould diſpoſe of all as pleaſeth him; to have <hi>our wills</hi> thus <hi>reſolved unto the Will of God.</hi> To have ſuch a frame of Heart as <hi>David</hi> had, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. —If <hi>I ſhall find favour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back again: But if</hi> otherwiſe— <hi>Behold, here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good vnto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When it is our hearty deſire, that we may be able to <hi>forſake all</hi> for God, and Jeſus Chriſt, to part with Eſtates, to give up Liberties, to lay down our very Lives for him, if he call us to it. This is to <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> not to will, or intend the keeping of any thing in the World, how dear ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us; but to be ready, and reſolved (in the ſtrength of his Grace) to part with all in his Cauſe. <hi>Self-denial</hi> is not without a <hi>will</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> even of <hi>ſuffering Martyrdom,</hi> by the help of his Grace, if the Lord call us to it: As they are joyned here, <hi>[Let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs.]</hi> And ſo it follows the Text, <hi>[For whoſoever will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it.]</hi> To <hi>will the ſaving of our Lives,</hi> or
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:92979:162"/>any thing we have, that God would have laid out for him; I mean, to <hi>will</hi> the ſame moſt <hi>intenſely,</hi> and <hi>prevailingly,</hi> is contrary to <hi>Self-denial,</hi> it is to prefer our own intereſt before God's Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When we are no more for depending on our ſelves, but for <hi>depending</hi> upon God, and on the Grace of God in Chriſt, for <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> for <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and for a gracious <hi>Recompence.</hi> This is the diſpoſition of a Self-denying Spirit; <hi>Self-denial</hi> is contrary to <hi>Self-dependence.</hi> Theſe things may help you to underſtand what Self-denial is, as in the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Self-denial in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> in brief, is not to live to our ſelves, but to the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. More plainly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a ſtrenuous <hi>oppoſing,</hi> and croſſing of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Self.</hi> A denying to <hi>make proviſion for the Fleſh;</hi> as to make no proviſion for Pride, to make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for Senſuality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be <hi>ſtarving out</hi> our Corruptions; to be <hi>beating down a body of Sin,</hi> to ſtrive againſt our Corruptions with might and main.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an uſing and <hi>employing what we have,</hi> what God intruſts us with, our ſeveral Talents, Eſtates, Powers, Intereſts, Parts, Gifts, <hi>&amp;c. not for our ſelves</hi> chiefly, and <hi>ultimately,</hi> but for God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is to <hi>reſerve nothing for Self,</hi> but <hi>actually</hi> to forſake all for God, which he calleth us to part with; to deny our ſelves of our deareſt Worldly Enjoyments, and our greateſt outward Comforts for him. <hi>[Let him deny himſelf] Se,</hi> i. e. <hi>animam ſuam; animam,</hi> i. e. <hi>vitam ſuam.</hi> A Man may not except ſo much as his <hi>own life;</hi> and a Man would give all he has for that, <hi>Job</hi> 2.4. <hi>[Let a Man deny
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:92979:163"/>himſelf] A ſeipſo procul abſit,</hi> according to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic Verſion.</hi> (Though in the phraſe of the World, <hi>Proximus ſum egomet mihi,</hi> A Man's ſelf is neareſt to him.) According to the <hi>Ethiopic Verſion, Odio ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebit animam ſuam,</hi> A Man muſt <hi>hate his own Life;</hi> as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>Let a Man deny himſelf:</hi> That is, Let him carry, as if he <hi>knew not himſelf,</hi> carry as if he loved not himſelf, as if he contemned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if he cared not what became of himſelf. We muſt have no regard of our Selves, have no regard of Eſtates, Liberties, or Lives; but ſeem <hi>prodigal of them,</hi> caſt away all we have in the World, rather than deſert God and Chriſt, to keep any thing here.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> is included in the particulars here laid down. Yet I ſhall ſhew fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by other Notes, how we may know, whether we have true Self-denial.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Self-denial is not without <hi>Self-abhorrence.</hi> Indeed it begins here, it begins in a loathing of our ſelves for Sin. Ordinarily <hi>Self-conceit</hi> reigns, till ſuch time as a Man is humbled, and comes to ſee his own Vileneſs, and abhors himſelf for Sin. One never truly <hi>denies</hi> himſelf, till he <hi>falleth out</hi> with himſelf. Firſt, there is a falling out with himſelf, and then a <hi>falling off</hi> from Self. But till we are thorowly diſpleaſed with our ſelves, we ſhall be ſtill <hi>adhering</hi> to our ſelves: And where <hi>Self-eſteem</hi> prevails, a Man is for <hi>Self-exaltation;</hi> both which are contrary to Self-denial. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, As <hi>one part</hi> of <hi>Self-denial</hi> is a denying, and <hi>forſaking our Luſts,</hi> taking their part no longer, making no more proviſion for them, and utter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning of them, with a Will and Reſolution to have no more to do with them; before we come
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:92979:163"/>to this, we muſt <hi>ſee the evil</hi> and baſeneſs of Sin, we muſt come to a loathing of it, and to a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves for it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) True Self-denial is not without Faith in the Promiſes, or without eying the <hi>recompence of Reward.</hi> We muſt ſee greater matters than thoſe things we are called to deny our ſelves in, far greater matters that God hath promiſed, or we ſhall never willingly and chearfully forgo Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Enjoyments for him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. It was by <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo willing to deny himſelf in <hi>point of Honour,</hi> refuſing to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter; and in <hi>point of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> chuſing rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon; and in <hi>point of Profit,</hi> eſteeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for Chriſt greater Riches, than the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For <hi>he had reſpect unto the recompence of the Reward.</hi> When a Man comes to ſee that the Lord does not bid him any loſs here, but that he ſhould be an everlaſting <hi>gainer by denying</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then he may chearfully deny himſelf; and otherwiſe, he will hang back. They cannot but account theſe <hi>hard ſayings, [Let a Man deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs: And if any Man hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſters,</hi> yea, <hi>and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.]</hi> I ſay, they cannot but account theſe hard ſayings, who are not aſſured of the truth of the <hi>Hundred-fold Promiſe,</hi> Mat. 10.29, 30. who are not aſſured, that Chriſt has greater things to give, and beſtow; better Riches, a better Name, a better Inheritance, a better Life, than that he calleth any to part with for Him. Now is Chriſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:92979:164"/>in ſo <hi>good Credit</hi> with us, that we dare take his Word here, that we dare put our whole Eſtates, all our Concerns, our very Lives into his Hand? Would we truſt him with all we have, upon his <hi>ſingle Bond?</hi> And are the things of another World ſo real, and certain to us, and ſo great in our Eye, that we cannot but diſpiſe all things here below, and count them but loſs, compared with the things above?</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) True Self-denial is not without the <hi>Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Love</hi> of God, and Jeſus Chriſt: As <hi>Self</hi> is taken down in any, God and Chriſt are <hi>exalted.</hi> As <hi>Self</hi> is loſing, Chriſt is gaining on the Soul. The more Self comes to be ſlighted, and diſregraded, the more Chriſt is eſteemed. The more <hi>Self-love</hi> is <hi>mortified,</hi> the more does the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>prevail,</hi> and take place. And if we love him not <hi>above our ſelves,</hi> how can we deny our ſelves for his ſake? He that loveth his Eſtate more than Chriſt, cannot be willing to part with his Eſtate for Chriſt. He that loves his Life more than Chriſt, cannot be willing to lay down his Life for Chriſt. Thus we can be no more ſound in the point of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> than we are in our love to God and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) True Self-denial is ever joyned with an <hi>humble frame</hi> of Heart. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though he was <hi>in nothing behind the chiefeſt Apoſtles,</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be <hi>nothing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>I have nothing to glory of,</hi> 1 Cor. 19.16. Self-denial is not for arrogating any praiſe, or honour unto <hi>Self,</hi> which is due to God, or would diminiſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from God's Glory. A Self-denying Spirit would not be pleaſed, but very much diſquieted
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:92979:164"/>with any praiſes from Men, which tend to rob God of the Glory due to his Name. He would abhor that Men ſhould attribute any thing to him, in a way injurious to the Honour of God.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Self-denial will teach us to <hi>ſubject our minds,</hi> and judgments to the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the Word. It is not againſt the <hi>uſe of Reaſon,</hi> (as was ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but againſt the <hi>exalting</hi> of Man's Reaſon above, or againſt the <hi>Wiſdom of God.</hi> It will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Reaſon</hi> to the <hi>word of Faith,</hi> which is indeed moſt reaſonable. <hi>Self-denial</hi> will take a Man off from <hi>Self-conceitedneſs,</hi> from being wedded to his own opinions. Self-denial will be pulling down <hi>ſtrong holds of Carnal Reaſonings, with every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledg of God.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth:</hi> So one that has learnt to deny himſelf, will not hold, or maintain any Error, or Opinion, contrary to the word of Truth, that he ſees the Word of God againſt. How plauſible ſoever it may ſeem to carnal and corrupt Reaſon, and how zealous ſoever he hath been for it, yet once ſeeing it diſagreeable to God's Word, he dare no longer own it.</p>
            <p>As we would not reject, and <hi>deny Chriſt,</hi> as Teacher, and <hi>Prophet,</hi> we muſt be willing to <hi>learn of Him,</hi> we muſt be ready to hear Him in all He hath to ſay to us. Acts 3.22. <hi>Him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore they that are <hi>wedded</hi> to their own <hi>Opinions,</hi> that have taken them <hi>for better, for worſe,</hi> and will not be taken off, though they have never ſo plain Scripture-evidence brought in againſt them, ſuch, I ſay, are not <hi>Self-denying</hi> Perſons, but
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:92979:165"/>rather <hi>Self-condemned.</hi> And they that are ſo <hi>in love</hi> with their own <hi>Notions</hi> and Conceptions, that they are rather for <hi>wreſting</hi> the Word, than for regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Conceptions by it: And they that are ſo <hi>conceited</hi> of their own <hi>Knowledg,</hi> and Abilities, that they are readier to deny, or queſtion the truth of what is held forth in God's Word, than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, or ſuſpect the <hi>ſhallowneſs</hi> of their own Apprehenſion, are not of a Self-denying Spirit. Alas, they are nearer denying God, than denying themſelves.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Self-denial mainly <hi>oppoſeth,</hi> and brings down a <hi>rebellious Will.</hi> As it is contrary to <hi>Self-conceitedneſs,</hi> ſo to <hi>Self-willedneſs.</hi> This is the great <hi>Controverſie</hi> betwixt God and Sinners, whoſe <hi>Will ſhall ſtand, his or theirs.</hi> But Self-denial, where it comes, <hi>decides the cauſe</hi> for God. One that truly denies himſelf, would have <hi>no will of his own,</hi> but what is ſubject to the Will of God. He reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſeth his own will, wherein he ſees it croſs, and contrary to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>And thus it is plain, They that walk in the <hi>way of their own hearts,</hi> that are fully bent upon their own wills, that give up themſelves in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe to follow their own ſinful Inclinations, are far from Self-denial. <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and a courſe of <hi>wilful diſobedience;</hi> Self-denial, and any reigning Sin, are things utterly inconſiſtent. A <hi>will to pleaſe God,</hi> and a <hi>will to pleaſe our ſelves</hi> in any way or courſe, which we know to be contrary to the Mind and Will of God, cannot be both together in a <hi>prevailing degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Self-denial is not conſiſtent with <hi>reigning inordinate Self-love.</hi> It's true, there is a <hi>regular
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:92979:165"/>Self-love,</hi> which is not contrary to Self-denial. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are none that do ſo truly <hi>love</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as thoſe that have learnt to <hi>deny themſelves</hi> for God and Jeſus Chriſt, who love God and Jeſus Chriſt <hi>above</hi> themſelves. But a corrupt <hi>Self-love,</hi> where it is <hi>predominant,</hi> excludes the true love of God, and the love of our Neighbour, and all true <hi>Self-denial.</hi> By this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a Man <hi>prefers,</hi> and eſteems himſelf, and his own things above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is moſt <hi>pleaſed with</hi> himſelf, and moſt <hi>devoted to</hi> himſelf; in ſhort, by this a Man <hi>makes an Idol</hi> of himſelf. This <hi>Self-love is blind</hi> indeed, and makes Men blind. It will not let a Man ſee the evil of his ſtate, and of his way, and courſe. It is a chief <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>Self-flattery,</hi> Self-deceit: But the grand impediment, and <hi>obſtruction</hi> of <hi>Self-denial.</hi> This Self-love is the <hi>heart of the Old-Man;</hi> till this be mortified, we can neither die to Sin, nor live to God. So while ſinful Self-love is in <hi>full power,</hi> we are far from Self-denial.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) Self-denial will <hi>heartily engage</hi> a Man againſt a ſenſual, <hi>fleſh-pleaſing</hi> courſe. For one to place his Happineſs in pleaſing his Appetite, or Senſes, in Meats, Drinks, fine Apparels Paſtimes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to mind ſuch things more, than the pleaſing, and enjoying of God; to be more ſet upon them, is a plain evidence that he <hi>is in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>walks after the fleſh,</hi> which is moſt contrary to a Self-denying life. Yea, though he do not run into the <hi>exceſs of Riot,</hi> which looſe, profane, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Perſons give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up unto.
<note place="margin">

               </q> It is enough to prove a Man a Senſualiſt, and ſtill for Self, while he aimeth at the pleaſing of his Appetite, or Senſes, even as <hi>his end,</hi> and looketh no higher; ſurely we ſhould be for pleaſing theſe no further, than may promote our main Work, may help us on in the lively, chearful Service of God. And whether we Eat, or Drink, or Recreate our ſelves at any time, that ſhould be our end, even that we may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſerve and glorifie our Maker, and Redeemer. Now ſuch as have no reſpect hereunto, and ſuch as are for pleaſing the Fleſh, though God be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, have not yet learn'd to deny themſelves. Self-denial would teach us to pinch and diſpleaſe, rather than pamper the Fleſh. And they that cannot <hi>deny their Exceſſes</hi> for God, ſtint their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Appetites, refrain from immoderate Recreations, cut off, and caſt away their proud and vain faſhions of Attire, that commend them to none, unleſs it be to light and vain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, how ſhall ſuch deny, and <hi>forſake all</hi> for God?</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) Self-denial is oppoſit to a courſe of <hi>Self-seeking,</hi> and will cauſe a Man habitually, and moſt ordinarily to prefer God's Intereſt above his own. Surely, they are altogether ſtrangers to Self-denial, that are all for ſeeking their own things, and not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts. And if we <hi>ſeek our own things</hi> more heartily, ſeriouſly, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, than the things of Chriſt, what would this ſhew, but that inordinate <hi>Self-love</hi> is <hi>predominant</hi> in us? And does it not argue <hi>plain ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> when Men are chiefly led by ſelf-ends, and moſt ſet upon
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:92979:166"/>
               <hi>ſelf-intereſt?</hi> when Men are more for their own intereſt, than for the intereſt of Chriſt? Now how full is the World of ſuch, as are for enriching, and advancing themſelves, who little or nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the advancement of the Kingdom and Intereſt of Chriſt? How many, whatever <hi>pretentions</hi> they make of <hi>ſerving Chriſt,</hi> yet their intentions, and <hi>deſigns</hi> are rather to <hi>ſerve themſelves</hi> of him! And that are indeed for no more of Religion, than will ſtand with, and promote their worldly intereſt, <hi>ſuppoſing that gain is Godlineſs</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5.) How many that will follow Chriſt no further, than may be in the way to riches and preferment in the World? But ſuch as have learn'd to deny themſelves, would not <hi>ſeek their own things</hi> above, or <hi>in competition</hi> with the things of Chriſt; but only <hi>in ſubordination</hi> to thoſe higher things. While others follow Chriſt but <hi>for ſelf,</hi> ſuch follow their worldly Callings, and ordinary Imployments <hi>for Chriſt.</hi> They are painful and diligent in their Callings: but if you ask <hi>who they work for?</hi> It is not for the fleſh, not for ſelf: but for God, and Chriſt. They are <hi>laying up</hi> for God, and <hi>laying out</hi> for God. When we have <hi>given our own ſelves to God</hi> (as they did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5.) account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves no more our own, we ſhall <hi>make over all we have</hi> to God, and ſhall deſire to uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our Parts, Intereſt, Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will. We ſhall not account any thing ſo <hi>our own,</hi> as for us to uſe how we pleaſe; but as may be moſt pleaſing to God. But if we are at exceſſive pains, and at great coſt and charge for Self; while we care not how little we are at in God's Service: if we think we can never <hi>lay up</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:92979:167"/>enough for Self, or care not how much we <hi>lay out on Self,</hi> and how little we lay out for God and Chriſt, if we think a little expended in works of Charity, or for Pious-uſes too much; ſuch things would bewray <hi>baſe ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> they are no ſigns of Self-denial.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) Self-denial will take a Man off from <hi>hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after</hi> vain applauſe. One of a ſelf-denying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is more for the favour, and approbation of God, than for the praiſe of Man. It's true, he may, and ought to <hi>prize a good Name,</hi> he would not do any thing to wound and blemiſh his Credit. But it is not ſo much on his own account, that he is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his good Name and Reputation; as upon the account of Religion, with reſpect to the credit of the Goſpel, and that he may be more ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and Men. But by no means would he have others to think, or ſpeak of him <hi>above that which is meet.</hi> He is for lifting up God's Name, not for lifting up himſelf. Such as are exceſſively taken with the praiſe of Man, and cannot bear up, but are diſcontented, if they be not extoled by others, are not of a ſelf-denying Spirit. Pride, and Ambition are not ſuffered to bear rule, where true Self-denial dwelleth.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) Self-denial would teach us to <hi>yield</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to <hi>juſt reproof.</hi> He that denies himſelf, would not deſpiſe, or refuſe reproof: he is willing <hi>to hear</hi> any thing <hi>againſt himſelf.</hi> When a Man has been provoked to deny, and diſown his Wife, to abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and caſt off his Son, if you have any thing to ſay againſt them, which he was ignorant of, he will be far from <hi>taking their parts.</hi> One that denies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would rather <hi>take part with God's Word</hi> againſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:92979:167"/>himſelf, than <hi>take part with Self</hi> againſt the Word. But now, ſuch as hate reproof, certainly they love carnal ſinful ſelf too well. Such as cannot endure to hear their Sins ſpoken againſt <hi>publickly,</hi> in the Miniſtry of the Word, and can much leſs endure to be told of them <hi>privatly,</hi> in a cloſe admonition, and home-reproof; they that are ſo tender, and <hi>fond of Self,</hi> that would not ſee, or hear any thing amiſs in themſelves; that are very impatient of ſuch doctrine as nearly toucheth Self, doubtleſs they have not yet learnt to deny themſelves.</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) Self-denial would make us ready to give <hi>admonition</hi> as there is occaſion, and make us <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in reproving</hi> others. This would not only make us humble, and tractible in receiving, but alſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in giving admonition, and reproof. And I ſcarce know which of theſe is more difficult <hi>to fleſh and blood,</hi> which of them requires more Self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. What is the cauſe that ſo <hi>plain a Duty,</hi> as that of reproving an offending Brother, or Neighbour, (as what duty can be more plainly laid down, than this, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17.) that a Duty ſo plain, is ſo little practiſed, ſo generally neglected? I ſay, what is the cauſe of it? Is it not from ſinful <hi>Self-reſpect?</hi> We cannot have the leaſt doubt, but God would take it well from us, if we be faithful in it; and if we thought, that Men would but take it as well from us, there is no queſtion, but many of us would not be ſo <hi>tongue-tied</hi> here. But we are afraid, by this means we ſhould loſe their friendſhip, yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make them our enemies. Thus ſelf-reſpect too generally prevails, and will not ſuffer us to ſhew any reſpect here to God's expreſs Command, or to the Souls of our Brethren. But when a Man has
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:92979:168"/>learnt this leſſon of Self-denial, if he be called to reprove, and rebuke Sinners, ſelf-reſpect being ſet aſide, he will not be ſo backward to this Duty.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) Self-denial is againſt <hi>ſinful ſloth,</hi> and for taking pains in God's Service. When <hi>the fleſh</hi> ſayes, <hi>Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf; Self-denial</hi> will <hi>ſay, No,</hi> Be not <hi>ſlothful in Buſineſs:</hi> and eſpecially take heed of ſloth in Spiritual Buſineſs: be <hi>fervent in ſpirit, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord.</hi> Self-denial will put a Man upon <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> though it be pinching, and grievous to the fleſh. It will put a Man upon <hi>taking Heaven by violence,</hi> by an <hi>holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> Such as reſt in a dull formality, will not be got <hi>out of that place;</hi> ſuch as take up with a few empty, heartleſs ſervices, as if any thing was good enough for God; they that would put him off with ſuch ſervice, as coſteth them little, or nothing, they plainly ſhew, that as yet they have not learnt to deny themſelves. Even <hi>carnal ſelf</hi> will allow of the <hi>eaſie part</hi> of Religion; it is a little more <hi>at eaſe</hi> for this, more at eaſe I ſay, than if a Man did caſt off all Religion.</p>
            <p n="14">(14.) Self-denial will incline one to <hi>charitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and make one helpful to others, according to his power. Herein <hi>Charity and Self-denial</hi> fully agree, that (as the Apoſtle ſayes, 1 Cor. 13.5.) <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſeeketh not her own:</hi> ſo neither doth <hi>Self-denial</hi> ſeek her own. The Apoſtle enjoyneth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Let no Man ſeek his own: but every Man anothers Wealth.</hi> Which can never be rightly obſerved, and diſcharged, without <hi>Self-denial.</hi> A ſelfiſh ſpirit is a baſe, private ſpirit; but a <hi>Self-denying</hi> ſpirit is a generous, <hi>publick</hi> ſpirit. Such a one is for doing all the good he can. When once we have learnt
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:92979:168"/>to <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> we ſhall ſcarce know how to <hi>deny others,</hi> when we have power to help and ſuccour them. If we have Eſtates, we ſhall conſider, we have them not for our ſelves; but to do good with them, to relieve thoſe that are in want. If we are <hi>cloſe-fiſted,</hi> or <hi>miſerable</hi> ſcanty in the matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution to the needy and diſtreſſed, it would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that <hi>Self</hi> has dominion in us ſtill, that Self bears the Purſe, and keeps the Keys with us.</p>
            <p n="15">(15.) Self-denial will diſpoſe a Man to love his very enemies, and to <hi>forgive injuries.</hi> He will be moved at thoſe who ſhew themſelves enemies to God. Self-denial will oppoſe the thoughts, or deſign of <hi>Self-revenge.</hi> We ſhall very rarely have a mind to ſtand up in <hi>Self's Quarrel,</hi> when <hi>Self</hi> is abandoned, and denied.</p>
            <p>One of a Self-denying ſpirit would be more <hi>concerned in God's cauſe,</hi> than in his own. So it is a good ſign, if all the reproaches Men caſt upon us, would not move and trouble us ſo much, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach caſt upon God, and his wayes: if we could be more eaſily reconciled to ſuch as have treſpaſſed ſore on us, and have been very injurious to us, than to wicked wretches that we ſee going on deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their treſpaſſes againſt God, and ſee to be ſet againſt the Intereſt of Chriſt. But if we are <hi>nearly touched</hi> with any thing ſaid or done againſt our ſelves, and as perſons unconcerned, in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations that Sinners offer unto God, and all that Chriſt ſuffers in his Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this looks ill, ſhews us to be ſtill <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> of a baſe <hi>ſelfiſh-ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">(16.) Self-denial would make a Man more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Church</hi> of God, than for himſelf. One of a Self-denying ſpirit would rejoyce more
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:92979:169"/>to ſee the Church of Chriſt in a truly flouriſhing ſtate (as it was in <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31.) to ſee the Kingdom of Chriſt enlarged, the Goſpel propagated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than he could rejoyce in his own advancement in the World, or in the increaſe of his own Eſtate. So on the other hand, he would lay to heart the Churches troubles and publick calamities, more than his perſonal,
<note place="margin">Leo Modena of the Rites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> part. 1. c. 2.</note> or family afflictions. They ſay, <hi>the Jews</hi> never build an houſe, but leave ſome part <hi>unfiniſhed,</hi> in <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalems deſolation;</hi> or they muſt write [the <hi>memory of the Deſolation</hi>] up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And the Churches Troubles ſhould be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven</hi> on all our Worldly Enjoyments. We ſhould take leſs delight in them, when ſhe ſits ſad and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary. A ſelf-denying Spirit, (as the Pſalmiſt) would prefer <hi>Jeruſalem's welfare before his chief joy,</hi> would make that the <hi>chief ingredient</hi> in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, (as Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>) Or though he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo low in the World, it would not trouble ſo much, as to think of the low eſtate of the Church, and the declining ſtate of Religion in the World. But if our own loſſes, croſſes, and afflictions lie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heavy on us, while the Churches miſeries <hi>lie light;</hi> if we have little ſenſe of theſe, are not <hi>grieved for the affliction of Joſeph;</hi> if it would ſadly ſtartle us to ſee our own Houſes on fire, and yet we are not moved to ſee <hi>fire caſt into God's Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;</hi> theſe things would ſhew miſerable ſelfiſhneſs, not Self-denial.</p>
            <p n="17">(17.) Self-denial would teach us to account our ſelves more happy in ſerving, pleaſing, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and enjoying God, than in having our <hi>fleſh pleaſed,</hi> in proſpering, or being our ſelves advanced
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:92979:169"/>in the World. Self-denial would cauſe us to be better ſatisfied, though the fleſh were pinched, and croſſed, while our Souls proſper, while Grace is vigorous and thriving, and while communion and intercourſe with God is maintained; then if our Souls were ſenſibly declining, Grace impar'd, our hearts more ſtraitned in holy Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though things went never ſo well with us in the World.</p>
            <p n="18">(18.) Self-denial would <hi>reconcile</hi> us to the <hi>ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Commands,</hi> that moſt fetter ſelf. This would make Chriſt's <hi>yoke eaſie.</hi> When Self is denied, we ſhall take part with the ſtricteſt Precepts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that bind up <hi>Self</hi> moſt.</p>
            <p n="19">(19.) Self-denial would alſo <hi>reconcile</hi> us to the <hi>harſheſt Providences,</hi> as a <hi>means</hi> to <hi>beat down ſinful Self,</hi> and baſe ſelfiſhneſs. When Self is denied, what <hi>oppoſeth Self</hi> will not be diſrelliſhed ſo as before it would have been. We ſhall be truly pleaſed, the more we <hi>get victory</hi> over our ſelves, by what ever means the victory be obtained; though it be not gotten <hi>without blows,</hi> without wounds in our fleſh, without breaches in our Eſtates, and outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p n="20">(20.) True Self-denial will prepare a Man for the croſs. He will not <hi>deny to ſuffer</hi> for Chriſt, who has learnt to deny himſelf: He that is come to <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> will readily <hi>take up the Croſs,</hi> to follow Chriſt. True Chriſtian Self-denial (if we have it) will have an anſwer ready for us, to give to the World, to give to any that would draw, or deter us from Chriſt, ſcil. That <hi>his we are</hi> (not our own) and <hi>him we will ſerve,</hi> and to him we will cleave, If Relations would draw us from him, we ſhall have this to ſay, That we are not <hi>theirs,</hi> ſo much
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:92979:170"/>as <hi>Chriſt's;</hi> and we had rather be <hi>His,</hi> than <hi>theirs.</hi> If Perſecutors would fright us from him, if they threaten to <hi>ſpoil</hi> us <hi>of our Goods,</hi> to take away our Eſtates, we ſhall have this to ſay, That we have, and would hold no Eſtates, but to be <hi>laid out</hi> for him, or <hi>laid down</hi> for him as he pleaſeth: If they threaten Death, That we are <hi>His,</hi> either to <hi>live to</hi> Him, or to <hi>dy for</hi> Him, which he pleaſeth; and that it is better for us to die for his Truth, in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than to live to deny his Truth, to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And this is Self-denial indeed, to ſeek the Honour of Chriſt, <hi>by the loſs of all</hi> that may be dear unto us in this World. Many would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to <hi>deny themſelves</hi> in <hi>ſome</hi> things here, rather than openly deny Jeſus Chriſt. They could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuffer a little for him, as to ſuffer Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment awhile, but not to ſuffer at a Stake; to <hi>run with the foot-Men,</hi> but not to <hi>contend with Horſes.</hi> As is indeed notably obſerved,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxt.</hi> Self-denial. p. 31.</note> 
               <q>A Man may <hi>deny Self for Self</hi> in many particulars, and ſo may <hi>pleaſe Self</hi> more than he <hi>denies</hi> it.</q> This is no true Self-denial. I would not be unfaithful to you. And ſo I muſt tell you, If it be thus, that you would not <hi>forſake all,</hi> rather than Chriſt, forſake all, I ſay, for Chriſt, when you may be called to it; if you are for keeping back a part, you do not yet deny your ſelves, yea, you have denied Chriſt already in your hearts, and therefore unleſs you be changed, have no ground to hope, that Chriſt will own you.</p>
            <p>I know many will count this an <hi>hard ſaying.</hi> But how oft does Jeſus Chriſt tell you as much?
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:92979:170"/>That if Jeſus Chriſt be to be believed, ſo it is. He alloweth us not to except any thing; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to be ready to lay down all, even our very lives for him. See Luk. 14.26. &amp; v. 33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you that for ſaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Though they were not called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>forſake all in act;</hi> yet in <hi>intention,</hi> and <hi>reſolution,</hi> they were to forſake all preſently, if they would be his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> They muſt be ready to bid adieu to all things in the World. So weigh the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Context, [Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs.</hi> — For <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it: but whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake, and the Goſpel's, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</hi>] That there is no being ſaved, (we ſee) without being <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that is, if not <hi>actually,</hi> yet <hi>intentionally,</hi> and <hi>habitually,</hi> having a will, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to lay down our very lives for Chriſt, if cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, if we cannot keep them with a good Conſcience, with our <hi>fidelity</hi> to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>One thing more you muſt note, that it muſt be <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> that we are willing to forſake all, or (though we ſhould forſake all) it would not prove us to be Self-denying perſons. If a Man was <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die</hi> in the maintenance, or profeſſion of the Truth, willing to lay down his life in this Cauſe, to be <hi>enrolled with the noble Army of Martyrs,</hi> to get an <hi>immortal Name,</hi> to have his Memory honoured when he is dead and gone, this is not true Self-denial. This would be <hi>dying to ones ſelf,</hi> and for ones ſelf, not to the Lord, and for the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, how we may know whether we have learnt to <hi>deny our ſelves.</hi> Yet I muſt grant, that <hi>Self-denial</hi> is <hi>imperfect</hi> here, as other Graces, And
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:92979:171"/>
               <hi>Self</hi> is never fully vanquiſhed in this life. It is oft making <hi>inſurrections</hi> in the Soul. Indeed it is <hi>a cloſe enemy,</hi> an enemy that lies <hi>very near</hi> us. The holieſt Men on Earth are one way or other diſturbed, and ſet upon with this enemy, <hi>Self.</hi> But they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to watch againſt it, they are fighting it, they oppoſe it, where-ever they meet with it. And it concerneth us to look well to our ſelves: for we can have no further evidence of the <hi>truth of Grace</hi> in us, than we have, that we are ſincerely Self-denying, and have not only our <hi>judgments,</hi> and Conſciences, but alſo the <hi>prevailing</hi> part of <hi>our Wills</hi> againſt baſe <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi>

            <p>AS the Lord <hi>takes pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.17. So it is a thing, that his Servants may <hi>take comfort</hi> in. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (though a King) found no ſuch <hi>Cordial</hi> in the World. He could take comfort in this, even when <hi>ſick unto death,</hi> when he had <hi>received the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death,</hi> Iſa. 38.1, 3. And this was their <hi>rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> who had little in the World to take comfort in. 2 Cor. 1.12. when they were <hi>as ſorrowful, and having nothing,</hi> yet they would not have parted with the joy of their Sincerity for all the World.</p>
            <p>God is ſo pleaſed with <hi>Sincerity,</hi> that where he ſees it, he is ready to <hi>overlook Infirmities.</hi> As true Gold has its <hi>grains of allowance.</hi> (Heb. 8.10, 12.)
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:92979:172"/>And <hi>all the paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth,</hi> to ſuch as <hi>walk before him in Truth,</hi> and Sincerity. He will be a <hi>Sun and Shield</hi> to ſuch: and <hi>no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.11. They ſhall have his favour, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance here. <hi>His Countenance doth behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> Pſal. 11.7. They have his moſt gracious, and <hi>benign Aſpect.</hi> And they ſhall be taken into, and enjoy his Glorious Preſence hereafter. Whereas <hi>an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite ſhall not come before him: the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ſhall dwel in his preſence,</hi> Pſal. 140.13. <hi>Who ſhall dwel in God's holy Hill?</hi> The Pſalmiſt tells you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.3, 4. He that hath clean hands, <hi>and a pure heart.</hi> Pſal. 15.1, 2. <hi>Such as walk uprightly.</hi> Thus indeed the end <hi>of the perfect,</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> Man <hi>ſhall be peace,</hi> perfect peace, and endleſs happineſs.</p>
            <p>But there is a <hi>twofold Integrity,</hi> or Uprightneſs. There is a <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> Integrity, and there is a <hi>Spiritual Integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>moral Integrity,</hi> which is the <hi>effect of common,</hi> reſtraining <hi>Grace.</hi> As God gives the Conſciences of ſome natural Men that power, and quickneſs, that in many particular actions they are ſeen to carry well, following the <hi>dictates</hi> of their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> Thus they are kept from groſs Sins, and ſhew forth many commendable Vertues; and that not out of <hi>Cunning,</hi> but of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Their Conſciences will not ſuffer them to do otherwiſe. As <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Brethren ſaid, <hi>We are true Men, we are no Spies.</hi> So many natural Men are true to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Many of the Heathen, (of whom we read in their Writers) were juſt, honeſt, plain-dealers, would ſpeak as they thought, and what ever they loſt or ſuffered, would not break their words, they
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:92979:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>were <hi>(homines quadrati)</hi> Square-men, and ſuch indeed as quite ſhame, and will condemn many that are called Chriſtians, who having baniſhed, or ſeared Conſcience, live in thoſe ſins, that many an honeſt Heathen would have choſen to die rather than commit. And the Lord himſelf gives teſtimony to the <hi>Integrity of Abimelech</hi> ſo far, that if he had known <hi>Sarah</hi> to have been another Man's Wife, he would not have taken her to his Houſe, Gen. 20.6. <hi>Yea, I know thou didſt this in the Integrity of thy heart.</hi> Yet we have no ground to ſuppoſe that <hi>Abimelech</hi> at that time was a Saint, a truly Upright Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Spiritual Integrity,</hi> which <hi>is</hi> the <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>ſpecial,</hi> renewing <hi>Grace.</hi> The effect of God's <hi>writing his Laws in the heart.</hi> When being <hi>renewed in the ſpirit of our mind, we put on the new Man,</hi> which <hi>after God is created in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Holineſs of Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23, 24. When not only a Man's <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but his <hi>Will</hi> alſo is for that which is right; not only in ſome particular actions, but in his <hi>general courſe.</hi> When a Man intirely, without reſerve, reſignes, and gives up himſelf to God, heartily reſolved for God, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily acting for him, with <hi>reſpect</hi> to his Will, and to his Honour and Glory, in what he does.</p>
            <p>Thus Integrity includes both being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in heart,</hi> and being <hi>of upright Converſation,</hi> Pſal. 11.2. with 37.14. They that are upright in heart, will be of upright converſation, will walk uprightly: and none can be of upright converſation, none can walk uprightly, without an upright heart.</p>
            <p>This uprightneſs is <hi>perfect for kind,</hi> though but <hi>imperfect,</hi> as to <hi>degree.</hi> As a <hi>Child</hi> has <hi>all the parts</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:92979:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>of a Man, though not in that full proportion, as a Man hath; but is growing toward it. But that Integrity which may be found in a natural Man, is but an imperfect <hi>Embrio,</hi> or a <hi>Falſe-Conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sincerity and Uprightneſs (to ſpeak <hi>properly</hi>) is not a particular, <hi>diſtinct Grace;</hi> but a <hi>neceſſary mode</hi> of all true Grace. It is the <hi>right mode</hi> of every Grace; and of every good Work too. So we read of the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of Love,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.8. of <hi>Love unfeigned,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.6. And of <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. Sincerity in a Chriſtians Graces, is as a <hi>Golden-twiſt</hi> in a Bracelet, <hi>or Neck-lace of Pearls,</hi> it goes thorow every Grace: or as the <hi>Veins</hi> in the Body, that run thorow all the Parts, and Members. Yea, Sincerity is as the <hi>Soul of Religion;</hi> without Sincerity, we can have no more than a <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> like a dead <hi>Carcaſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to ſhew, how Sincerity and Uprightneſs may be known. O that I might be a <hi>welcom Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> to ſome, to ſhew ſome their Uprightneſs, who cannot reſt, but long to be ſatisfied in this Point.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Upright Man, (though <hi>ſimple,</hi> plain) is not <hi>ſtolid.</hi> Though there is an <hi>holy ſimplicity</hi> joyned with <hi>Sincerity,</hi> (2 Cor. 1.12.) yet a <hi>brutiſh ſtolidity,</hi> groſs ignorance and integrity are utterly inconſiſtent. Pro. 19.2, 3. <hi>That the Soul be without Knowledg, is not good.</hi> (In our old Tranſlation thus, <hi>For without Knowledg the mind is not good.</hi>) The <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of Man perverts his way.</hi> Indeed ignorance is both <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Nurſe</hi> of <hi>Impiety:</hi> but no friend to Integrity. Prov. 2.13. <hi>Walking in the wayes of darkneſs,</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>keeping the paths of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> As the <hi>Simple,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>err,</hi> are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.20. Pro. 1.22. <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity?</hi> There is a <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> that is
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:92979:173"/>no <hi>vertue.</hi> It is <hi>the Man of underſtanding that walketh uprightly,</hi> Pro. 15.21. Not <hi>the fool,</hi> Pro. 19.1. He is perverſe. Some reſt in their <hi>good meanings,</hi> and boaſt of their good, and honeſt hearts; while they have no care to know <hi>what is the good, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perfect will of God:</hi> ſuch are not upright.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Upright Man is for knowing the <hi>whole Will and Counſel of God.</hi> He is willing to hear of his duty, to learn his whole duty; He would not ſtop his ear againſt any Meſſage, that comes from God. The <hi>ſingle eye ſees beſt,</hi> Mat. 6.22. It would not ſhut out any light that comes from above, from the <hi>Father of Lights.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we tranſlate <hi>Sincerity,</hi> ſome would have taken from the <hi>Eagles</hi> trying of her young, holding them forth to the full view of the Sun, who (as they ſay) rejects thoſe as ſpurious, and not her genuine brood, which cannot with open eye behold the <hi>Sun:</hi> or (as moſt take it) the word is tranſlated from <hi>Wares,</hi> that are right good, that one is not afraid to ſhew, and bring forth into the light of the Sun. When Men <hi>hate the Light,</hi> and will not come into the Light, it argues unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But <hi>he that doth truth, cometh to the Light,</hi> Joh. 3.20, 21. To <hi>do Truth,</hi> and to <hi>walk in Truth</hi> is as much as to walk with an upright heart, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.3. And ſuch as are for <hi>walking in Truth,</hi> are for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Light, for knowing the Truth, the Will and Word of God, the rule they are to walk by, Mic. 2.7. <hi>Do not my Words do good to him that walks <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightly? Annon placebunt verba mea?</hi> as ſome, Will not my words pleaſe him? Yea, indeed it will do much good, it will pleaſe them well, to hear from God, to know more of his mind. <hi>[He that hath
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:92979:174"/>ears to hear, let him hear.]</hi> We have that expreſſion often. All have not <hi>ears to hear,</hi> as the Upright have. But where the Lord has a <hi>mouth to ſpeak,</hi> the upright Man has an <hi>ear to hear.</hi> He will ſay ſtill, <hi>Speak Lord, thy Servant heareth.</hi> The Upright heart is that <hi>good and honeſt heart,</hi> Luk. 8.15.

               </note> which is both ready to receive, and careful to keep the Word. The <hi>Sincere Milk</hi> of the Word will readily down, and agree well with <hi>Sincere hearts.</hi> Upright words, words of truth will be very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.10.) to true upright hearts. Falſe, deceitful, and unſound hearts are willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and willing to be deceived in many points. But a plain, honeſt heart would pray, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, Pſal. 119.29. <hi>Remove from me the way of lying; and grant me thy Law graciouſly.</hi> And (as it is in <hi>Job</hi>) what <hi>I ſee not, teach thou me.</hi> When ſuch come to the Word they can ſay (with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10.33.) <hi>Now are we here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> They would entertain every Divine Truth, welcom every Word of God. They would chuſe the way of truth, when diſcovered, how croſs ſoever to their worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, or to their former apprehenſions and opinions. As Pſal. 119.30. <hi>I have choſen the way of Truth.</hi> And v. 162. <hi>I rejoyce at thy Word, as one that findeth great Spoil.</hi> As the Truth and Will of God was further revealed to him, he was very much joyed, as one that had got a rich prize.</p>
            <p>And thus an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright heart</hi> and a <hi>corrupt mind</hi> will not dwell together. That the Upright Man
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:92979:174"/>has a will and deſire to know the whole Counſel of God, ſo far as is his concern, and duty; this is a ſpecial <hi>preſervative</hi> from undoing errors, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in Religion. Pſal. 37.31. <hi>The Law of his God is in his heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide.</hi> Pro. 11.3. The Integrity of the Upright ſhall guide them. And v. 5. The <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Perfect ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his way.</hi> Pro. 13.6. <hi>Righteouſneſs keepeth him that is upright in the way.</hi> Prov. 21.29. <hi>As for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right he directeth his way.</hi> If he has been drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to error, into <hi>by paths,</hi> he does not harden his face, as reſolved to perſiſt in his courſe: but looks about him, conſiders, and ſo comes to underſtand his errour and to ſee the right way, which his heart is for walking in.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Upright Man is <hi>willing to be ſearched,</hi> is for ſelf-ſearching. Truth ſeeks no corners, (though it may ſometimes be driven into corners.) Such as deal with <hi>deceitful Wares,</hi> will keep their Shops dark, or uſe falſe-lights; but if you mean honeſtly, and your Commodities be right, you are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to bring them into the light. And he that will neither deceive others, nor be deceived himſelf, certainly, that Man is not in a way <hi>of ſtudied Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.</hi> See how the <hi>Man after God's heart</hi> prayeth, Pſal. 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts. And ſee if there be any wicked way in me.</hi> The meaning may be, that he would have God to <hi>diſcover</hi> him more fully <hi>to himſelf,</hi> as well as <hi>clear</hi> up his <hi>integrity to others.</hi> God's <hi>ſearching</hi> and <hi>trying</hi> Men is not for his <hi>own information;</hi> but to make them known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or others. The Pſalmiſt was ſo <hi>willing</hi> to have his <hi>heart ſearched,</hi> that he <hi>prayes</hi> earneſtly for it. <hi>Search me, O God, and try me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="332" facs="tcp:92979:175"/>
            <p>And this is an <hi>hopeful ſign</hi> of Sincerity, if thou art for ſtrict and ſerious Self-examination, and much in it. As a godly Miniſter told me, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, That it was ſome ſtay to him then, that he had loved <hi>uſes of Examination,</hi> that it was very pleaſing to him to read, or hear that part of the Application of the Word ſoundly proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Hypocrites are for <hi>enquiring into others,</hi> for a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row obſerving, and cenſuring of others; rather than for ſearching, and <hi>examining themſelves.</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites uſe to be quick-ſighted abroad, but have no mind to look home, love to be great ſtrangers at home. As <hi>decayed Tradeſmen,</hi> broken Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have no delight to look into their <hi>Books of Accounts;</hi> ſo Hypocrites, thoſe deceitful Chapmen, care not for looking into the Books of their own Conſciences.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) A ſound upright Heart, will <hi>approve</hi> of <hi>ſound</hi> and wholeſome <hi>admonition</hi> and reproof. To <hi>take reproof well,</hi> as it is a ſign of an humble, Self-denying ſpirit, ſo of an <hi>upright heart.</hi> And one that deſires to <hi>walk uprightly,</hi> will be glad to be told of it, when he has <hi>ſtepped awry,</hi> or turned out of the way: <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite him, it ſhall be a kindneſs,</hi> Pſal. 141.5.</p>
            <p>If ſound and wholſome Admonition will not down with us, it would ſhew our hearts unſound. An upright heart would not <hi>hate him that reproveth,</hi> would not <hi>abhor him that ſpeaketh uprightly.</hi> They were <hi>Lying Children,</hi> which <hi>ſaid to the Prophets, Propheſy not unto us right things, ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, propheſy Deceits,</hi> Iſa. 30.9, 10. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart is for <hi>right things;</hi> whilſt the unſound
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:92979:175"/>heart is more for pleaſing Deceits. And the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite can worſt of all endure to hear any thing againſt his beloved <hi>Boſom-ſin.</hi> As <hi>Herod</hi> could not bear it, when <hi>John</hi> told him of his <hi>Herodias,</hi> Mat. 14.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The upright Heart is not for hiding Sin, but for a plain and hearty confeſſion of it. The word tranſlated <hi>Perfect, [mark the perfect Man]</hi> ſignifies <hi>Plain,</hi> or <hi>Simple,</hi> Perfect,
<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> or Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. The perfect upright Man, is a <hi>plain Man.</hi> As <hi>Jacob</hi> was a <hi>plain Man,</hi> Gen. 25.27. it is the ſame word. He hath not thoſe cunning ſhifts, as others uſe. <hi>Simplex, ſine plicis,</hi> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fold, and wrap up an evil Matter, as others will do. As <hi>Job,</hi> an upright Man, had not the art to <hi>keep his Sins cloſe.</hi> Job 31.33. <hi>If I had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my Tranſgreſſions as</hi> Adam, (or, after the manner of Men) by <hi>hiding mine Iniquity in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi> The <hi>plain Heart</hi> knows not how to <hi>cover</hi> Sin: The upright Man is one, <hi>in whoſe ſpirit is no guile,</hi> Pſal. 32.2. He has no will to diſſemble, or conceal his Sins, or to excuſe, or extenuate them. Some think, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> looks eſpecially to that <hi>plainneſs,</hi> freeneſs, <hi>open-heartedneſs in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> whereunto the pardon of Sin is promiſed, (as we find in other Texts of Scripture, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9.) And what follows there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 5. doth very much countenance ſuch an interpretation: <hi>Bleſſed is the Man, unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>in whoſe ſpirit there is no Guile.</hi> Then it follows, <hi>When I kept ſilence, my Bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long.— I acknowledg my Sin unto thee, and mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have I not hid: I ſaid,</hi> (i. e. reſolved) <hi>I will
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:92979:176"/>confeſs my Tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt the iniquity of my Sin.</hi> And he freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his Sin not only to the Lord, but to Man, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13.</p>
            <p>Hypocrites, like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> are for <hi>juſtifying themſelves:</hi> And what they cannot juſtifie, they will mince, and <hi>extenuate</hi> all they can. How much ado had the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> with <hi>Saul,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his Sin? And after all, he could not be brought to a free, ſerious, and hearty Confeſſion. He <hi>confeſſeth,</hi> but not without <hi>an excuſe,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.24. Hypocrites are not for confeſſing, till they can no longer <hi>hide</hi> their Sins. Or if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſome Sins for <hi>faſhion-ſake,</hi> they are uſually ſuch as the beſt are not free from. They have ſtill a deſire to keep <hi>cloſe</hi> their <hi>Boſom-ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) The upright Man has left <hi>halting betwixt two,</hi> is really reſolved for God, and entirely devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Thus his heart is <hi>perfect with</hi> God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.61. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. his heart is for God before all other; it is not <hi>divided</hi> betwixt God, and other things. The Hypocrites heart, like the <hi>Adultereſſes,</hi> is <hi>divided,</hi> divided betwixt God and Mammon, divided betwixt God, and his Luſts. That is a falſe, adulterous heart, that is divided betwixt God, and other Lovers: But bleſſed <hi>are they that ſeek him with the whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.2. <hi>Sic ut eum ſolum quaerant &amp; diligant, reliqua tantùm propter Deum.</hi>

But the phraſe, <hi>with all the heart,</hi> and with the <hi>whole heart,</hi> muſt be taken in a more <hi>favourable</hi> ſenſe here. So the <hi>whole heart,</hi> and a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> is oppoſed to a <hi>double heart,</hi> a divided heart, an <hi>heart and an heart.</hi>

               </gap>, A <hi>double-minded Man,</hi> is the Character of an Hypocrite, <hi>James</hi> 1.8. He has <hi>two ſouls</hi> (as it were) <hi>one</hi> inclining him towards God and Chriſt, and Heaven; <hi>another</hi> inclining more ſtrongly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the World, towards Worldly Riches, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Vain-glory, or Applauſe. He is <hi>double-ſoul'd,</hi> and therefore <hi>unſtable,</hi> not knowing where to fix. When he would give up himſelf to his Luſts, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is pulling him back; and when he ſhould give up himſelf to God, his <hi>Luſts</hi> draw him back. And his heart being never truly ſet on God, it is more eaſily drawn from him, than from the World,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:92979:177"/>from his Luſts, which he is more for.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True: Yet ſo, that the <hi>Spirits intereſt is predominant,</hi> the prevailing bent of the Heart, and Will is for God. But the Hypocrite is ſtill <hi>halting betwixt two Opinions,</hi> his heart divided betwixt God and the World. <q>Like a Man that is <hi>in bivio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the new Cov.</hi> p. 225.</note> in a double way (as Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> has the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) he ſtands and looks on both, and knows not which to take:</q> So the double-minded Man looks upon God, and looks upon the World; and one while he is <hi>for God,</hi> another while <hi>for the World.</hi> He ſtands thus in ſuſpence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the upright Man is <hi>come to his choice,</hi> he is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what way to take, and all the World cannot turn him. His <hi>heart is fixed</hi> upon God, his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thorowly ſet for God. Though honeſt hearts do find <hi>unſteadineſs, as to Degrees;</hi> yet they are not unſettled, as to the Object. The prevailing <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bent</hi> of ſuch hearts, is towards God; though they are not carried out towards him with the like ardency of Affection, and like vigorous endeavours at all times.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) The upright Man is one that <hi>loves the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity,</hi> Cant. 1.4. <hi>The upright love thee.</hi> Hypocrites, unſound Profeſſors, do but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the Upright only love him indeed. Thus the Apoſtle concludes his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians, [Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity.]</hi> Here all the Hypocrites in the World fall ſhort, and are cut out. While an Hypocrite in <hi>outward actions,</hi> may
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:92979:177"/>may ſeem to <hi>out-do</hi> many a ſincere Chriſtian; yet in the point of <hi>affection</hi> he is utterly wanting. He wants that, which ſhould be the <hi>main ſpring</hi> of his actions. He is wholly acted from <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and by ſelf-reſpects, not from love to Jeſus Chriſt, which is the cauſe of that great <hi>unevenneſs</hi> in the courſe of Hypocrites. They are not ſteady; <hi>but off and on,</hi> moved to and fro, as ſelf-intereſt, and <hi>ſelf-reſpects</hi> move and incline them. While it is for their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and profit, and is like to make way for their preferment to <hi>profeſs his Name,</hi> they would be ſorry that any ſhould be more forward to own Chriſt, and his wayes, than they: but when the <hi>wind bloweth in another quarter,</hi> ordinarily they will then <hi>face about,</hi> and ſhamefully retreat: or if they hold on, yet it is ſtill from ſome ſelf-reſpect, not from real love to Chriſt. But the Upright heartily love him, and therefore cleave to him with full purpoſe of heart, and <hi>follow him fully,</hi> even when he is moſt deſpiſed, and oppoſed. Like thoſe good Women, to whom the <hi>Angel</hi> ſpake, Mat. 28.5. <hi>Fear not ye: for I know that ye ſeek Jeſus, which was crucified.</hi> They that love Chriſt indeed, will continue <hi>ſeeking</hi> him, when moſt deſpiſed, when perſecuted, when <hi>crucified.</hi> And if our hearts be not with Chriſt, they cannot be ſound, and upright.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) The Upright Man is careful in his ordinary courſe to <hi>walk before God,</hi> to carry as <hi>in God's ſight</hi> and preſence. Gen. 17.1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou Perfect,</hi> or Upright. Uprightneſs <hi>in heart</hi> and <hi>life</hi> is not attained without a ſenſe of God's preſence with us, without <hi>ſetting the Lord before us.</hi> So 1 King. 9.4. <hi>If thou wilt walk before me, as</hi> David <hi>thy Father walked in integrity of heart, and in uprightneſs.</hi> Iſ. 57.2.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:92979:178"/>
               <hi>each one walking in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs.</hi> Others have it, <hi>before Him,</hi> (as it is in the Margent) <hi>each one that hath walked before him.</hi> Indeed one cannot walk <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> that does not walk <hi>before him.</hi> 2 Cor. 2.17. <hi>of Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>in the ſight of God,</hi> go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And it is ſomething to this purpoſe, that they <hi>that know God,</hi> and the <hi>upright in heart,</hi> are joyned, Pſal. 36.10. As <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and they <hi>that forget God,</hi> are put together, <hi>Job</hi> 8.13. The Upright ſo know God, as to remember him, they have their thoughts much upon him. The Hypocrite <hi>forgets</hi> God, thinks little of him. He puts off the ſerious thoughts of God, of his Omnipreſence, of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as otherwiſe he could never go on ſtill and quietly in a way of Hyprocriſie. The Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ordinarily ſo <hi>mind God's Preſence</hi> with them, his eye upon them, that they are awed therewith, and <hi>fear before him.</hi> He that <hi>walkes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightly,</hi> is ever one that <hi>feareth the Lord,</hi> Prov. 14.2.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) The Upright Man is one that <hi>hates,</hi> oppoſes, and <hi>forſakes</hi> all known Sin. There is no Sin he knows of, that he would ſpare and indulge. And this is a certain <hi>infallible note,</hi> and caracter, if we can find it in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in heart,</hi> and the <hi>Pure in heart</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſame.</p>
            <p>Queſt. But <hi>who can ſay, I have made my heart clean? I am pure from my Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, an <hi>abſolute perfect purity</hi> is not to be found in any upon Earth, but only in Heaven, yet the Upright are ſaid to be of a <hi>clean heart,</hi> and to have a <hi>pure heart</hi> (Pſal. 73.1. and 24.4.) <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively.</hi> That is, <hi>compared with themſelves,</hi> what they were, before God <hi>created</hi> this <hi>clean heart</hi> in them,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:92979:178"/>and <hi>put a right ſpirit</hi> into them; as alſo compared <hi>with others,</hi> that are ſtrangers to the work of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual renovation. So the <hi>denomination</hi> follows the <hi>better part.</hi> As we ſay, <hi>a Corn-field,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are many <hi>Weeds</hi> in it too. And a <hi>Gold-Mine,</hi> though there is much <hi>Droſs</hi> with the Gold. And there is this further to be ſaid, that though there is ſin and <hi>impurity</hi> ſtill <hi>cleaving,</hi> and adhering to the Upright Man; yet his <hi>heart cleaves</hi> not to any ſin. It is ſo far pure, it is not for joyning, or <hi>mingling</hi> with corruption; but would <hi>work it out.</hi> There is no <hi>way of wickedneſs</hi> allowed of in the heart, that is upright.</p>
            <p>This laſt note is clearly laid down, Prov. 16.17. <hi>The high-way of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright is to depart from evil.</hi> This is the <hi>common path</hi> ſuch daily keep unto. In their <hi>ordinary courſe</hi> they have a care to <hi>depart from evil,</hi> from evil <hi>in genere,</hi> which contains the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or kinds of evil. So <hi>Job</hi> that was a <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> Man, ſhewed it in his <hi>eſchewing evil,</hi> Job 1.1. Though the Upright Man cannot live ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free from ſin; Yet neither can he <hi>live in</hi> ſin. It is not his <hi>Element.</hi> Though ſin has a being in him ſtill; yet it has not <hi>dominion</hi> over him. Pſal. 19.13. <hi>Let them not have dominion over me: then ſhall I be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright.</hi> There is <hi>reigning ſin,</hi> which a Man does not oppoſe; but gives up himſelf unto, which he willingly ſerves, and obeys: and this is altogether inconſiſtent with Uprightneſs.</p>
            <p>Again, there is ſin which is <hi>not reigning,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, which a Man does not allow of, but deſires and endeavours to ſhake off, Watches, prays, ſtrives againſt: and the <hi>exiſtence,</hi> or preſence of ſuch ſin does not deny, or diſprove a Man's Uprightneſs.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:92979:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>An upright Man may <hi>fall into Sin;</hi> but he does not <hi>continue in</hi> Sin. It is not his way. But his <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way is to depart from</hi> evil.</p>
            <p>Here is a broad difference betwixt the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and the Upright.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Hypocrite will ſometimes ſeem very <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> againſt <hi>Sin in others,</hi> and be forward to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and condemn others; while he willingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooks, and <hi>indulges Sin in himſelf.</hi> He can ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>eſpie a mote in anothers</hi> Eye, than <hi>a beam in his own</hi> Eye. An upright Man, though he would not partake of others Sins by Connivance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he ſets eſpecially againſt his own Sins, and againſt ſin in thoſe that are neareſt to him: In the firſt place he would <hi>reform at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. An Hypocrite may leave <hi>ſome Sins,</hi> as <hi>Jehu</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Baal,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> probably reformed in ſome things: But the Upright Man is an Enemy to all known Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An Hypocrite is for <hi>lopping off the Branches:</hi> But the upright Man is <hi>ſtriking</hi> even at the <hi>root of</hi> Sin. He is for mortifying that body of Sin within him. He is <hi>ſick of that body of Death.</hi> He ſtrives in good earneſt againſt inward evil Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. An Hypocrite, whilſt he keeps his <hi>hands clean</hi> from groſs acts of Sin, has no care, takes no pains to <hi>purifie his heart.</hi> Whilſt he avoids open Prophaneneſs, he tolerates, and allows of inward Corruptions, and <hi>Heart-pollutions,</hi> Mat. 23.25, 26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The upright Man's care is to caſt, and keep Sin out of his Heart, as well as out of his Life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An Hypocrite is not <hi>afraid of doing</hi> that in <hi>God's ſight,</hi> which he would be afraid, or aſhamed to do in the view of others; or if he thought Men
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:92979:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>would come to the knowledg of it. The upright ordinarily dread to ſin <hi>in ſecret,</hi> fear to ſin againſt God, though it were poſſible to keep it cloſe from the knowledg of the World.</p>
            <p n="5">5. An Hypocrite will <hi>condemn</hi> the Sins of <hi>former Times,</hi> while he is eaſily drawn to a compliance with the ſins and corruptions of the preſent Times he liveth in; like thoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.29, 30, 34. But an upright Man will be <hi>good in bad Times:</hi> As <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6.9. Noah <hi>was a juſt Man, and perfect,</hi> or <hi>upright in his Generation.</hi> In that wicked Age, wherein Iniquity did ſo much abound, and defile the World, yet ſtill he <hi>retained his Integrity.</hi> He was a <hi>juſt,</hi> a righteous Man, when the Earth was <hi>filled with violence.</hi> He <hi>walked with God,</hi> even at that time, when Mankind generally, as with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, lay wallowing in Sin. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.4, 5. They that are <hi>upright in heart,</hi> are oppoſed to ſuch as <hi>turn aſide unto crooked ways.</hi> They cannot wind about, and turn with the Times, as others. An upright Man <hi>hates the work of them that turn aſide,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, it <hi>ſhall not cleave to him,</hi> Pſal. 101.3. Pſal. 26.11. <hi>But as for me, I will walk in mine Integrity. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, Rectitude,</hi> and <hi>Streightneſs,</hi> are words of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near, and great affinity. An upright Man is for conforming himſelf to the Word, a <hi>ſtreight Rule,</hi> is not conformed to the World, cannot bend to the ſinful humours, and examples of Men.</p>
            <p n="6">6. An Hypocrite ſometimes whilſt he abſtains from <hi>groſs Sins,</hi> freely allows himſelf in <hi>leſſer Sins,</hi> or ſuch as he accounts little, <hi>Peccadillo's.</hi> Take that Inſtance the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> gives, James 1.26. <hi>If any Man among you ſeem to be Religious, and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, this
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:92979:180"/>Man's Religion is vain.</hi> Some will ſeem to have a care of their <hi>Actions,</hi> who have no care of their <hi>Words.</hi> Words are but Wind with them. And (as a Learned Man obſerves) <q>'Tis the Hypocrites Sin.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr. Manton</hi> on <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. pag. 357.</note> They abſtain from <hi>groſſer Actions,</hi> but uſually offend in their <hi>Words,</hi> in <hi>boaſting Profeſſions,</hi> and proud <hi>Cenſures.</hi>
               </q> A ſound upright Man would not offend, ſo much as <hi>in Word,</hi> (James 3.2.) Such as have no care to <hi>bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> and govern their Tongues, to keep them under a Law; the Apoſtle tells us, their Religion is vain. So an ordinary allowance of any known Sin, as accounted little, will not ſtand with Uprightneſs, which engageth the Heart againſt all known Sin.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Sometimes an Hypocrite will ſeem very ſtrict, and <hi>tender in leſſer matters,</hi> and very nice, and ſcrupulous about ſome things lawful; whilſt he makes no bones of Sins indeed, and very great Sins, if he can but get any cover for them. Like thoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.24. who would <hi>ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel.</hi> They that would not have eaten with <hi>unwaſhen hands,</hi> yet care not how they <hi>defiled</hi> them with Oppreſſion, with cruel and unjuſt Practices; ſuch are far from the <hi>Path of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi> The upright Man indeed would abſtain from the <hi>appearance of evil;</hi> and much more from <hi>apparent Evils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. An Hypocrite, whatever Sins he may ſeem to abandon and forſake, yet has ſome <hi>beloved Sin,</hi> and generally ſome fleſh-pleaſing, or gainful Sin, that he knows not how to part with, which he <hi>hides in his boſom.</hi> But here now I come to the <hi>good old mark</hi> of Sincerity, (as one calls it) which
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:92979:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>Divines have uſed to lay down: The upright Man has a ſpecial care to get down, and keep down any ſuch Sin, or Sins, as he finds himſelf moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto. And here we may apply that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was alſo upright before him; and I kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi> Indeed I find a learned Man referring this to that paſſage, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.9, 11. where <hi>David</hi> would not take the faireſt opportunity to revenge himſelf on <hi>Saul,</hi> to get rid of his greateſt Enemy. When, had he conſulted with Carnal Reaſon, that would readily have prompted him with ſpeed to diſpatch his Enemy, to provide for his own ſafety; yet he reſolutely withſtood the Temptation, and what Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have inclined him to; and neither would himſelf lay violent hands on <hi>Saul,</hi> nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to do it. Thus the greater temptations one has to Sin, if they are heartily reſiſted <hi>(ſi caetera ſint paria)</hi> it is a greater evidence of ones Integrity and Uprightneſs. As in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.9. and <hi>Job,</hi> Job 2.3. and <hi>David</hi> here.</p>
            <p>But divers give the ſenſe, which is to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, (though indeed the words may be taken more largely) <hi>I kept my ſelf from mine Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>] i. e. From the Sin, unto which by <hi>Nature, Conſtitution,</hi> or the like, he was moſt prone. So that is an upright heart indeed, which is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its <hi>Boſom-ſin.</hi> He is an upright Man, who hath not any Sin that he would not gladly part with.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Uprightneſs and Sincerity are more <hi>directly oppoſite,</hi> and in a ſpecial manner contrary to ſuch Sins as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>way of Hypocriſie,</hi> a <hi>way of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>walking by the falſe line of Carnal Policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Sincerity is moſt oppoſite to <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> The
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:92979:181"/>Hypocrite deſires to ſeem good, rather than to be good. Of <hi>Machiavil</hi>'s mind, he thinks the <hi>name,</hi> and repute of being Religious, and Conſciencious, may be <hi>of uſe</hi> to his deſigns; but that the <hi>thing it ſelf</hi> would be a <hi>burden.</hi> The ſincere upright Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, would be better than he ſeems; the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is only for making a ſhew. He feigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be what he is not, and makes a ſhew of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what in very deed he does not. The upright Man is one, <hi>in whoſe ſpirit there is no ſuch ſtudied guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>ſtate of Hypocriſie,</hi> when Men pretend to be devoted to God, and his Service, while it is nothing ſo, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.1.) Their hearts are rotten, and <hi>falſe to God,</hi> and ſtill in <hi>league</hi> with their Luſts. Now a ſtate of Hypocriſie is plainly inconſiſtent with true Grace, Sincerity, and Uprightneſs.</p>
            <p>Again, There is <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> in ſome particular <hi>Acts,</hi> and in ſome <hi>Degree.</hi> As to ſeem more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, intent, and fervent in Duty, in hearing the Word, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to ſeem more eminent in this, or that Grace, than one is really. This <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Hypocriſie</hi> (as we may call it) though very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, may ſtand with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs in the main.</hi> Only take this note along with you, That as an upright Man eſpies, and reflects upon it, he cannot but loath himſelf for it. He has worſe thoughts of himſelf for this; and he is working it out. It is not a thing that he allows. Reigning, and <hi>allowed Hypocriſie</hi> is a clear proof of an unſound inſincere Heart. The upright Man is one in whom is no <hi>allowed guile.</hi> He is humbled for what Hypocriſie he finds in himſelf, he hates, he reſiſts it. Though Hypocriſie be ſometimes preſent with thee, if it be
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:92979:181"/>not <hi>prevalent,</hi> if it has not dominion over thee, it will not prove thee an Hypocrite. <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> is not a <hi>burden</hi> to an Hypocrite, it reſts in his heart, as <hi>in ſuo loco,</hi> in its natural ſeat, and proper place.</p>
            <p>Further, If others have better thoughts of thee, have an <hi>higher opinion</hi> of thy Gifts, and Graces, than there is real ground for; yet if it be without thy <hi>affecting,</hi> or ſeeking by diſſimulation, or feigning to be better than thou art; and if it be <hi>contrary to thy will,</hi> and <hi>liking,</hi> it is no fault of thine, but the other's Error, and Miſtake.</p>
            <p>Yea, further: If thou art putting thy ſelf oft upon good Diſcourſe, (as thou haſt opportunity) though (alas!) thou findeſt thy heart dead, and dull, little affected with the things of God at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of which thou chuſeſt to diſcourſe; yet this is not to <hi>act the part of an Hypocrite,</hi> it is not the Sin of Hypocriſie, when thy <hi>end</hi> in ſpeaking, is to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> thy own heart, and thoſe that hear thee, (which is good) and not to <hi>ſeem more affected</hi> than thou art. When thou doſt not <hi>deſign to ſet off thy ſelf,</hi> but indeed to edifie thy ſelf, and others, ſo far thy heart is right, and ſincere; though it be not ſo warm, and lively, as it ought to be. And what is here noted of Chriſtian Conference, the like may be ſaid of praying with others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Sincerity and Uprightneſs have a <hi>peculiar contrariety</hi> alſo to a <hi>way of Lying,</hi> or deceitful Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Mentiri eſt contra mentem ire,</hi> to ſpeak contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ones mind, or thoughts. And how contrary is this to Plain-heartedneſs? The Upright will <hi>ſpeak uprightly,</hi> Iſa. 33 15. His <hi>words are of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs</hi> of his heart, (<hi>Job.</hi> 33.3.) <hi>A righteous Man hateth Lying,</hi> Prov. 13.4. That it is a falſe ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:92979:182"/>to ſay of ſuch, Though they will not <hi>Swear,</hi> yet they <hi>will Lye.</hi> An upright Man is ſo far from uſing, and allowing, that he <hi>hates,</hi> and abhors it. As the Pſalmiſt profeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.163. It's true, many a moral honeſt Man would ſcorn to Lye; but a <hi>righteous Man hateth</hi> Lying, ſo as a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt</hi> does not. He hates it, not only as <hi>ſhameful,</hi> but much more as <hi>ſinful,</hi> as ſtrictly forbidden by God. Lev. 19.11. <hi>Neither lye one to another.</hi> Col. 3.9. <hi>Lye not one to another.</hi> Epheſ. 4.25. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore putting away Lying, ſpeak every Man truth with his Neighbour.</hi> He hates it as highly diſpleaſing, and hateful to God. Prov. 6.16, 17. <hi>Theſe ſix things doth the Lord hate, yea, ſeven are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto him,</hi> (an <hi>abomination of his Soul</hi>) a proud Look, a <hi>lying Tongue,</hi> &amp;c. So Prov. 12.22. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lips are an abomination to the Lord:</hi> But they that deal truly, are his delight. And how terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Sentence is that we read, againſt all Lyars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. where they are joyned with the <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> and <hi>abominable,</hi> with <hi>Murderers, Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> of all whom it is ſaid, that they <hi>ſhall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to Lying we may refer <hi>Jeſuitical Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> When they have pleaded for it all they can, yet it will be found but a more cunning, <hi>artificial way of Lying,</hi> and contrary to that dealing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly, which is the Practice of upright ones. <q>But by <hi>this device</hi> (as one ſays) <hi>Peter</hi> might well and truly have <hi>denied Chriſt,</hi>

            <p>One ſays of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> that he never told Lye. That was very high: Yet no upright Man is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, one that loves and trades in it. A <hi>way of Lying,</hi> and <hi>walking in Truth,</hi> are as contrary as Light and Darkneſs. He that <hi>walketh uprightly,</hi> is alſo one that <hi>ſpeaketh the Truth in his Heart,</hi> Pſal. 15.2. His Heart and Tongue well agree. He in <hi>whoſe heart is no guile,</hi> will have a care to <hi>keep his Lips from ſpeaking guile.</hi> They were <hi>treacherous Men,</hi> that did <hi>bend their tongues like a Bow to ſhoot forth Lyes, that taught their Tongue to ſpeak Lyes,</hi> Jer. 9.2, 3, 5.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) To walk uprightly is contrary to being <hi>led by Carnal Policy.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>In ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom</hi> — we have had our converſation in the World. <hi>Holy Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> godly Sincerity, and <hi>fleſhly Wiſdom,</hi> are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites. Carnal, or <hi>fleſhly Wiſdom,</hi> may be ſo called upon ſeveral accounts: As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ratione Principij,</hi> in reſpect of its Principles. It is <hi>originally</hi> from <hi>the Fleſh,</hi> the carnal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt part, as <hi>Spiritual</hi> Wiſdom is from the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Ratione finis,</hi> in reſpect of its <hi>End.</hi> It is only for <hi>Carnal ends,</hi> for ſerving a Carnal intereſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ratione formae,</hi> it is according to the <hi>Law of the Fleſh,</hi> not of the Spirit. Not according to the <hi>rule of the new Creature,</hi> but according to the courſe and practice of carnal Worldly Men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Ratione efficientiae,</hi> It is Fleſhly, not only <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter,</hi> but <hi>Effectivè.</hi> As the <hi>product</hi> of Carnal Wiſdom, are baſe, carnal, ſinful ſhifts; and the <hi>influence</hi> and tendency of it, to make one more
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:92979:183"/>addicted to the Fleſh, more Carnal, Senſual, and Earthly. It is impoſſible, that one, who is led, and ſteers his courſe by the principles of Worldly Wiſdom, ſhould <hi>walk uprightly. Godly Simplicity</hi> indeed excludes not a <hi>lawful Prudence:</hi> but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to carnal Policy. We ſhould be <hi>wiſe as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> (as the Serpent is quick-ſighted, and wary to avoid dangers:) But withal we muſt be <hi>innocent</hi> (ſimple, ſincere) <hi>as Doves,</hi> Mat. 10.16. The wiſdom of the Serpent, muſt by no means devour the innocence of the Dove. As ſome have ſaid, <q>The <hi>Serpents eye</hi> does well only in the <hi>Doves head.</hi>
               </q> And be we ſure of this, that carnal Policy, which puts any upon uſing ſinful, indirect Courſes, to <hi>ſecure,</hi> or raiſe themſelves in the World, will in the end prove <hi>Folly.</hi> As he that getteth Riches, and not by right, — at his <hi>end ſhall be a Fool,</hi> Jer. 17.11. It is true, we find <hi>Jacob</hi> once in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſſage, to have uſed much Craft, and <hi>Wili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> when he feigned himſelf to be <hi>Eſau</hi> (though ſome would excuſe it) for which he ſmarted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But as he is called a <hi>Plain Man,</hi> (not a <hi>Cunning Hunter,</hi> like <hi>Eſau</hi>) ſo was he Plain-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Plain-dealing</hi> in the main, and general courſe of his Life. As for his <hi>Policy</hi> uſed in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>'s ſervice, Gen. 30.37. that might be by <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al direction</hi> from the <hi>Angel</hi> of God, as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.11. He had been greatly wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Laban,</hi> but God by his Providence would thus right him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.9.</p>
            <p>The Upright Man is for making the <hi>will of God his Rule,</hi> not the wiſdom of the Fleſh. He walks by that Rule in his general Courſe, and while he carries <hi>like himſelf.</hi> If ſometimes Carnal Policy
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:92979:183"/>has led him aſide, yet he comes to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other Sins, that Uprightneſs is ſpecially oppoſite unto: But I fear being too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The upright Man has <hi>a reſpect to all God's Commands.</hi> And herein doth Uprightneſs mainly conſiſt: <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed,</hi> (ſays the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <hi>when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. For this he is called, a <hi>Man after Gods own Heart,</hi> Acts 13.22. <hi>I have found</hi> David <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>a Man after mine own Heart,</hi>

               <hi>which ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil all my Will.</hi> He had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all God's Commands. He would <hi>take his work before</hi> him, not pick and chooſe, not have ſome regard to one Command, and deſpiſe another. <hi>Impartial,</hi> Univerſal <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> is a ſure note of <hi>Integrity;</hi> as <hi>Partial Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is a ſign of <hi>Hypocriſie:</hi> To <hi>ſtand perfect,</hi> and to be <hi>filled,</hi> or <hi>compleat in all</hi> the <hi>Will of God,</hi> are joyned, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. Indeed, the obedience of the beſt on Earth is but <hi>Imperfect,</hi> they come not up fully to any one of God's Commands; but though it be imperfect, it is not <hi>Partial.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> was for taking part with the whole Law of God, and every part of it, he would not have deſired any one Precept nulled, abrogated, Pſal. 119.128. <hi>I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right.</hi> Or as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> reads it, <hi>All thy Precepts, even all I have approved.</hi> Et vid. Annot. in loc. The Hypocrite cannot ſay ſo; he accounts ſome of them too hard, too ſtrict. If he allows of ſome Commands, yet he could wiſh others aboliſhed. The upright Man
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:92979:184"/>is for one, as well as another, and <hi>in will, deſire, purpoſe,</hi> and <hi>endeavour,</hi> he obeyeth all God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he does not allow himſelf in the breach, or contempt of any one known Command: And this is to <hi>walk uprightly,</hi> to do <hi>according to all God's Commands.</hi> 1 Kings 9.4. <hi>If thou wilt walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, as</hi> David <hi>thy Father walked, in integrity of heart, and uprightneſs, to do according to all that I have commanded.</hi>— As he that <hi>believes any Truth</hi> upon the Teſtimony of God in his Word, upon the ſame ground, for the ſame reaſon muſt believe the <hi>truth of whatſoever</hi> God hath ſaid in his Word: So he that <hi>obeyeth</hi> in this, or that particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath commanded it, hath a <hi>will to obey all</hi> that God hath given in Command. Thus the upright Man's obedience to one Command, is upon a <hi>general Ground,</hi> common to all God's Commands. And hereupon he is <hi>uniform</hi> in his Obedience. But the obedience which the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite performeth, is upon lame, unſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and <hi>partial Grounds;</hi> and ſo his obedience is lame, ſhort, and partial, like the Grounds of it.</p>
            <p>But attend well to this note I am upon. To walk Uprightly is to <hi>walk in all the Commandments of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. And ſo</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Upright Man hath a <hi>reſpect to both Tables.</hi> An Upright Heart is <hi>another Arke,</hi> where the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of God's Laws are kept, even both Tables. Thoſe which God hath joyned, one after God's Heart would not ſeparate. Such a one would <hi>keep a Conſcience void of offence both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men,</hi> (Act. 24.16.) <q>Look what kind of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:92979:184"/>
                  <hi>honeſty</hi> to Man that is, which is not accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Religion</hi> towards God, the ſame (ſayes Mr. <hi>R. Bolton</hi>) is that <hi>Religion</hi> towards God, which is not attended with <hi>honeſty</hi> to Men. Both in one <hi>predicament,</hi> as he ſayes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How can he be Upright before God, who does not make Conſcience of Duties to God? <hi>Job was Perfect, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, and one that feared God,</hi> as we read, <hi>Job</hi> 1.1.</p>
            <p>And further, Uprightneſs teacheth to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Duties towards Men. For which ſee <hi>Job's</hi> ſerious profeſſion of his Upright carriage, <hi>chap.</hi> 31. So the Apoſtle ſayes, Heb. 13.18. <hi>We truſt we have a good Conſcience, in all things willing to live honeſtly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Upright Man is a <hi>good Man.</hi> Mic. 7.2. <hi>The good Man is periſhed out of the earth: and there is none upright among Men.</hi> Pſal. 125.4. Thoſe that <hi>be good,</hi> and them <hi>that are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in their heart,</hi> go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The Upright ſet themſelves to follow the rule of the Word, which teacheth them to be <hi>good in their Relations.</hi> As Pſal. 101.2. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a perfect way — I will walk within my Soul with a perfect heart.</hi> The Upright Man will be a good Maſter. Or ſuch a one will make a good Servant, (if he be in that Relation.) <hi>Obeying not with eye-ſervice,</hi> but in <hi>ſingleneſs of heart,</hi> (Col. 3.22.) not <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyning, but ſhewing all good fidelity,</hi> (Tit. 2.10.)</p>
            <p>The Upright Man is a <hi>juſt Man.</hi> Job 12.4. <hi>The Juſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Man</hi>— He is juſt in his dealings. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and <hi>Injuſtice</hi> are at great <hi>odds</hi> as can be, theſe will never agree while the World ſtands. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:92979:185"/>will not <hi>mingle</hi> with fraud and deceit.
<note place="margin">Sincerum, quaſi ſine cerâ.</note> The honeſt heart is for <hi>honeſt dealing.</hi> Such as are Sincere before God, will deal truly, ſincerely, fairly, candidly with Men. As there is an expreſſion, Judg. 9.19. <hi>If ye have dealt truly and ſincerely with</hi> Jerubbaal, <hi>and with his Houſe.</hi> Such as <hi>make a trade</hi> of cozening, defrauding, wronging their Neighbours, let their pretences be never ſo fair, their courſe of practice will prove them falſe, unſound. How incongruous is it, to have <hi>Jacob's Voice,</hi> and <hi>Eſau's rough hands?</hi> Verily, <hi>a cheating Profeſſour</hi> is much worſe than a known <hi>profeſſed Cheater.</hi> And ſee Deut. 25.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Deceitful Weights,</hi> and <hi>deceitful Meaſures,</hi> are the <hi>inventions</hi> of <hi>deceitful Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many, that are enriching themſelves with the <hi>wages of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs?</hi> Such cannot ſay, as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23, 24. <hi>I was upright before him — Therefore hath the Lord recompenſed me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my righteouſneſs, according to the cleanneſs of my hands in his Eye-ſight.</hi> Nor are ſuch ever likely to have any evidence of their Uprightneſs, till they come to follow ſuch Counſel as that, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Break off thy Sins by Righteouſneſs, and thine Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the Poor.</hi> As God <hi>ſmites his hand</hi> at <hi>Mens diſhoneſt gain</hi> (Ezek. 22.13.) So will the Upright <hi>deſpiſe the gain of oppreſſions,</hi> or <hi>deceits,</hi> and <hi>ſhake his hands from holding of bribes,</hi> Iſa. 33.15.</p>
            <p>Yea the Upright Man is not only <hi>juſt,</hi> but <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,</hi> Pſal. 112.4. Unto <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> there ariſeth light in darkneſs: <hi>he is gracious and full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> (as well as) <hi>righteous.</hi> So the <hi>Merciful</hi> and <hi>

            <pb n="353" facs="tcp:92979:185"/>
            <p n="2">2. The upright Man would not <hi>deſpiſe the leaſt of Gods Commands.</hi> He is for keeping them, as <hi>the apple of his Eye,</hi> (as there is an expreſſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.2.) with all care and <hi>tenderneſs.</hi> His care is to <hi>walk</hi> circumſpectly, <hi>exactly.</hi> That <hi>preciſeneſs</hi> which prophane ſpirits deride, and ſcoff at, he ſees to be neceſſary. That ſuppoſing a Man to keep <hi>the whole Law, excepting one Point,</hi> which he <hi>allows himſelf to offend in,</hi> by contemning God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therein, his Obedience would thus be proved unſound, and he be proved <hi>guilty</hi> in reſpect of <hi>the whole Law,</hi> (James 2.10.) He thus deſpiſing that ſame Authority, upon which the whole Law depends. For one to allow himſelf in the <hi>breach of the leaſt</hi> of Chriſt's Commands, accounting it of little weight, that it was no matter, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not; this is enough to ſhut one <hi>out of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The upright Man (though he does not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe,</hi> and contemn the <hi>leaſt</hi> of God's Commands, yet he) <hi>looks firſt</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> to the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: He has a ſpecial regard to theſe. As the contrary detected the <hi>Hypocriſy of the Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that as ſtrict as they were in leſſer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet they were groſly negligent of the greater, and more weighty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23, 24. To be very obſervant of, and <hi>zealous about Circumſtantials,</hi> but careleſs of more neceſſary Duties, and ſubſtantials of Religion, is one <hi>ill-favoured mark</hi> of an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, whereby he may be known.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The upright Man has a reſpect to the <hi>hardeſt Commands,</hi> even to ſuch Commands as are moſt croſs to his Carnal intereſt, and Natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So this evidenced <hi>Abraham</hi>'s integrity, that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:92979:186"/>when God called for his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he <hi>withheld not his Son, his only Son from him.</hi> Thus (on the other hand) the unſoundneſs of the <hi>young Man,</hi> that was ready to boaſt of his obedience, was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Mat. 19.21. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect</hi> (Mark 10.21. <hi>one thing thou lackeſt) Go, and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the Poor — and come and follow me.</hi> Chriſt knew his mind, how his heart was let up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World; and to ſhew that his heart was not right, nor he ſo <hi>perfect,</hi> as he took himſelf to be, he tried him with a Command, that was croſs to his Carnal Intereſt, and to his ſpecial Inclination, which ſoon laid him open. As willing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as he ſeemed to know and learn his Duty, yet when he hears of <hi>ſelling all,</hi> and <hi>taking up the Croſs,</hi> (Mark 10.21.) he leaveth this <hi>hard work</hi> for others.</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) The upright Man carries <hi>uprightly</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>holy Duties.</hi> Here</p>
            <p n="1">1. He has a care to engage <hi>his heart</hi> to approach to God. Thus his <hi>Prayers</hi> proceed not from <hi>feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lips,</hi> Pſal. 17.1. So he <hi>praiſeth</hi> God with <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs</hi> of <hi>heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.7. The Hypocrite thinks it enough to <hi>draw nigh to God with his Mouth,</hi> and <hi>to honour him with the Lips,</hi> Mark. 7.6. <hi>Well hath</hi> Iſaiah <hi>propheſied of you Hypocrites, as it is written; This People honoureth me with their Lips, but their Heart is far frem me.</hi> The Hypocrite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf with a form of Godlineſs, with meer <hi>Bodily Exerciſe.</hi> The upright Man is a <hi>true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper,</hi> one that <hi>worſhippeth God in Spirit, and in Truth,</hi> (John 4.23. Phil. 3.3.) The upright Man takes not up with any outward Form, but laboureth for an <hi>inward frame,</hi> ſutable to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:92979:186"/>he performs. 2 Chron. 29.34. <hi>The Levites were more upright in heart, to ſanctifie themſelves,</hi> than the Prieſts. The upright Man looks not only to the <hi>matter of Duty,</hi> but to the <hi>manner</hi> alſo, how it is to be done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The upright Man is not one <hi>preſt</hi> to God's Service, but a <hi>Volunteer</hi> in his Service.

               </gap>, which properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Simplicity,</hi> is oft uſed for <hi>Freeneſs,</hi> or <hi>Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> The ſimple and ſincere heart, is a <hi>free heart.</hi> It is free in God's Service, and accounts his ſervice perfect Freedom. The Hypocrite ſets to Duty as <hi>a Task,</hi> and <hi>Burden;</hi> he is glad when a duty is over. The upright Man's <hi>heart is in theſe ways.</hi> Holy Duties (that are means of ſpecial Communion with God) are his beſt <hi>Meal-times.</hi> Job 23.12. <hi>I eſteemed the words of his Mouth, more than my neceſſary Food.</hi> Such would not know how to live without the Word, without Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The World could not hire them to lay Duties aſide, by all it has to proffer. True, the upright Man finds not at all times the <hi>like chearfulneſs</hi> in God's Service: But the <hi>ſpirit is willing,</hi> when <hi>the fleſh is weak.</hi> Or if his Spirit be ſometimes <hi>ſtraightned,</hi> 'tis his <hi>burden</hi> when it is ſo: And he prays to be <hi>eſtabliſhed with a free ſpirit.</hi> When he finds any liſtleſsneſs unto, and wearineſs in God's Service, it is a thing he is <hi>weary of.</hi> He has <hi>little joy</hi> in any thing, while he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:92979:187"/>take <hi>delight in God,</hi> and his Wayes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The upright Man has a <hi>ſpecial reſpect unto God</hi> in Duties. He looks moſt at God's Approbation. Having a <hi>reſpect to every known Duty,</hi> and having <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God in all,</hi> are great ſigns of Uprightneſs. To look <hi>ſtraight forward,</hi> (Prov. 4.25.) the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite <hi>looks aſquint.</hi> He has not a <hi>right intention</hi> of ſerving, honouring, and pleaſing God in what he does. The Upright looks moſt at God: The Hypocrite looks moſt at Men. He <hi>does all to be ſeen of Men,</hi> (Mat. 6.5. &amp; 23.5.) The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite would think all his labour loſt, if he have not Man's applauſe, or approbation. He loves <hi>the praiſe of Men, more than the praiſe of God,</hi> (like thoſe <hi>John</hi> 12.45.) The Upright little regard Man's commendation, or cenſure either: (As it was <hi>a ſmall thing</hi> with the Apoſtle, to be <hi>judged of Mans judgment</hi>) but he would account all loſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, without God's Approbation, and Acceptance. He would not that his praiſe ſhould be of Men, but of God. He more <hi>dreads</hi> than <hi>courts</hi> Man's applauſe: Or if he finds himſelf ſometimes tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and taken with it, <hi>in cool blood</hi> he abhors himſelf for it. But if he may know, that God has accepted his Work, the Lord's <hi>[Well done, good and faithful ſervant,]</hi> would <hi>do him good at heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The upright Man is for <hi>ſecret Duties.</hi> He makes conſcience of them, delights in them. The Lord ſhall ſee his <hi>Nathaniel's under the Fig-tree,</hi> in their private Walks, in their Cloſets. He ſees them oft retiring themſelves. The Hypocrite, who is only for making a ſhew, cares not for ſecret Duties, which Men can take no notice of. If Conſcience
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:92979:187"/>will not let him alone, without doing ſomething here, yet he has no love to them, he is very ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The upright Man is, not only for Duties that are <hi>in faſhion</hi> and credit among Men, but thoſe that may expoſe him to Scorn, or Perſecution. As <hi>Daniel</hi> would hold on <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>giving Thanks</hi> to God, when it was likely to coſt him his Life, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. The upright Man ſtudies the <hi>Point of his Duty,</hi> more than his own <hi>ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">(13.) The upright Man is an <hi>humble</hi> Man. Such as walk uprightly, alſo walk humbly, (<hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8.) Though <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> are oft made all one in Scripture, yet the Upright have only a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Parts</hi> here: but as to <hi>Degrees,</hi> they ſtill find great imperfection in themſelves, that humbles them. As the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not as though I were already perfect.</hi> The more Gracious, the more Humble: As the <hi>higheſt Stars</hi> ſeem leaſt. None are ſo ſenſible of the leaſt ſinful warping, or ſtepping awry, it troubles none ſo much as thoſe, whoſe greateſt care is to walk Uprightly. There is a <hi>Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their Filthineſs,</hi> Prov. 30.12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, his Soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him,</hi> Hab. 2.4. <q>
                  <hi>Hypocrites</hi> (as a ſound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſays) is but the <hi>off-ſpring of Pride.</hi>
               </q>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="14">(14.) The upright Man is one that <hi>walks by Faith,</hi> walks in the Name of the Lord, <hi>(Zech.</hi> 10.12.) We can walk, and <hi>ſtand upright</hi> no longer than we are ſtrengthened by him: And it is Faith that fetcheth in ſtrength from him. Cant. 8.5. <hi>Who is this that cometh up from the Wilderneſs, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:92979:188"/>upon her Beloved.</hi> Upright Souls ſee a neceſſity of the Grace and Aſſiſtance of Chriſt, and ſo lean and depend on him.</p>
            <p n="15">(15.) The upright Man is <hi>ſteady and even</hi> in his Courſe. But Hypocriſie is a cauſe of unſteadineſs, of inconſtancy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.8.— <hi>A Generation that ſet not their heart aright, and whoſe ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God.</hi> And ver. 37. <hi>Their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> The Hypocrite is good only by fits. He is in a <hi>good Mood</hi> ſometimes; but it is ſoon over. This will not prove one upright, to take a right ſtep, or two: But we muſt be upright in the Way, and upright in our general Courſe. Pſal. 106.3. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep Judgment: and be that doth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs at all times. [At all times]</hi> when <hi>alone,</hi> as well as while in company with the Good: at <hi>home,</hi> and abroad: On our own Days, as well as on the Lord's Day: In <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and Adverſity: Not only when Righteouſneſs is applauded, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, but when it meets with the ſevereſt checks, and greateſt rubs. The upright, though they may ſometimes <hi>ſtumble in the way,</hi> or ſtep aſide, through Frailty; yet they do not <hi>wickedly depart from it,</hi> through falſeneſs of Heart, and baſe Treachery. The <hi>ſettled bent</hi> of their Hearts, and ſo the <hi>general courſe</hi> of their Lives, is right.</p>
            <p n="16">(16.) The upright Man is <hi>ſtriving after,</hi> and growing up towards <hi>full Perfection.</hi> The <hi>Righteous ſhall hold on his way: And he that hath clean Hands wax ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> Thus the Way of the Lord is ſtrength to the Upright. And his Word does good to the Upright, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7. It is an <hi>ill ſign,</hi> when one is at a conſtant ſtay in Religion.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:92979:188"/>When one holds on <hi>in a round of Duties,</hi> without going forward. And commonly Hypocrites go out at laſt in a <hi>ſtinking ſnuff.</hi> But the <hi>Path of the Juſt is as the ſhining Light, which ſhineth more and more unto the Perfect Day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. <hi>Such are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing towards the Mark,</hi> Phil. 3.14, 15.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Zeal</hi> is a word of various acceptation. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it ſignifies <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>fervour.</hi> From <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ferveo.</hi> In Heb. 10.27. there is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which we read <hi>fiery indignation,</hi> in our old Tranſlation, <hi>violent Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Word is transferred to the heat, and fervour of the Spirit and Affections, which is of diverſe kinds. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>natural Zeal.</hi> As ſome naturally
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:92979:189"/>are of lively, active ſpirits, full of mettle, (as we uſe to ſay.) <hi>Luther</hi> ſeemeth to have been naturally of ſuch a temper. As <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaid of him, <hi>Nihil in eo non vehemens.</hi> What an happy thing it is, when ſuch a temper is guided, and acted by Grace. Ordinarily ſuch will do more for God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>carnal Zeal.</hi> We find <hi>emulations,</hi> among the works of the Fleſh reckoned up, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. In the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> condemns <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>bitter Zeal,</hi> Jam. 3.14. <hi>Envy</hi> is a kind of Zeal; but not of the right kind. It is <hi>bitter</hi> Zeal. It is a ſort of <hi>wild Grapes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Blind</hi> Zeal. Such as Idolaters, Papiſts, Perſecuters may be acted by. A blind zeal, when Men are Zealous in a falſe way, and Zealous againſt the Truth. Taking <hi>light for darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>darkneſs for light.</hi> Calling good evil, and evil good.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> extravagant, and <hi>erratick</hi> zeal, when Men are Zealous about ſuch things, where it would be a vertue to be cool and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>And there is an <hi>Hypocritical</hi> Zeal, when Men have, or ſeem to have great Zeal for the Truth, and againſt Errour, and falſhood; but it is only for ſelf-reſpects, and <hi>carnal ends.</hi> Thus <hi>carnal</hi> Zeal moves in a <hi>large Sphere,</hi> takes a great compaſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>Spiritual Zeal.</hi> A being zealous of good Works indeed, and zealous for God, even for his ſake. An holy Zeal. This is both commanded, Rev. 3.19. <hi>Be zealous.</hi> And commended, Num. 25.11. <hi>Phinehas the Son of Eleazer hath turned my wrath away</hi> (while <hi>he was zealous for my ſake.)</hi> So this Zeal ſhould not go unrewarded.</p>
            <p>Many commend lukewarmneſs <hi>and indifferency in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:92979:189"/>Religion,</hi> under the terms of <hi>Moderation,</hi> Prudence, and Diſcretion. But Chriſt and the World are not of a mind. A <hi>lukewarm</hi> temper the Lord cannot endure. Rev. 3.15, 16. <hi>Becauſe thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my mouth.</hi> But as Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> obſerves, (<hi>Vol.</hi> 1. p. 903.) <q>The goodneſs of God winks at the <hi>Errors</hi> of honeſt Zeal, and ſo loveth the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of good Affections, that it paſſeth over their <hi>Infirmities.</hi> Again, (<hi>ib.</hi> p. 938.)</q> 
               <q>He Pardoneth the <hi>Errours</hi> of our <hi>ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> rather than the <hi>indifferencies</hi> of <hi>lukewarmneſs.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed where there is <hi>no Zeal</hi> for God, there is <hi>no Love</hi> to God. <hi>Qui non Zelat, non amat.</hi> Where there is <hi>Life,</hi> there will be ſome <hi>heat.</hi> Here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be ſpiritually <hi>alive</hi> and to be <hi>lively,</hi> are not more alike in ſound, than really akin. Zeal in one degree or other is as inſeparable from ſpiritual Life, as heat is from fire. It's true, as every ſincere Chriſtian is not a <hi>Nathaniel</hi> for degree and meaſure of Sincerity, and plain-heartedneſs; So neither is every ſuch Soul a <hi>Moſes,</hi> a <hi>Phinehas,</hi> an <hi>Elias</hi> for Zeal: Yet <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> Mat 11.12. And it is one property of Chriſt's redeemed ones, his <hi>peculiar People, to be zealous of good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This holy Zeal, of which I am to ſpeak, (as was ſaid of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi>) is not any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, <hi>particular Grace;</hi> but a <hi>modus,</hi> or <hi>reſpect</hi> of other Graces. Though ſome define it as a <hi>compound of Love and Anger. (Zelus eſt affectus ex amore &amp; irâ mixtus, cum ſcil. iraſcimur ei, à quo laeditur id quod amamus.)</hi> Yet I cannot ſo confine it. There muſt <hi>be Zeal</hi> accompanying our <hi>Repentance,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.11. And Zeal in our <hi>Love.</hi> We muſt <hi>love fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:92979:190"/>and 4.8. And it is the ſymtom of corrupt times, when <hi>love waxeth cold,</hi> Mat. 24.12. Zeal is the <hi>ſprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigour,</hi> and activity of all Grace, the <hi>ardor</hi> of all the Affections, with the earneſtneſs and intention that is in all ſpiritual actings. Indeed the <hi>chief heat</hi> of it is <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Rom. 12.11.) This <hi>Fire</hi> is burning in the gracious Heart, in the ſanctified Will and Affections; yet its <hi>heat</hi> is further diffuſed into the Converſation. All our Spiritual <hi>Sacrifices</hi> muſt be <hi>offered</hi> up with this <hi>Fire. Fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Prayer muſt be Zealous, <hi>fervent Prayer,</hi> Jam. 5.16. Col. 4.12, 13. Miniſters muſt Preach <hi>zealouſly,</hi> as Apollos, Act. 18.25. None are allowed to do the work of the Lord negligently, remiſly. There muſt be Zeal in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word. Here our <hi>hearts</hi> ſhould <hi>burn within</hi> us, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.32. we ſhould be zealous in reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. Yea, no good work is <hi>well done</hi> without Zeal. We muſt be <hi>zealous</hi> of, and zealous in good Works. Its not enough barely to do good Works: but we muſt be earneſt upon it, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the <hi>Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall we know whether our Zeal be right.</p>
            <p>Anſw. (1.) True <hi>Zeal</hi> is <hi>guided</hi> by a <hi>right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> a judgment regulated by the Word. To al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that, Iſa. 4.4. <hi>The ſpirit of judgment</hi> muſt go along with the <hi>ſpirit of burning.</hi> A blind, ignorant, raſh Zeal is not good, nor will it prove ones eſtate good. Such a Zeal <hi>Paul</hi> had, while a deſperate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.9. which afterwards he ſaw to be fury, and <hi>madneſs,</hi> rather than <hi>Zeal.</hi> v. 11. This made him <hi>Mad</hi> once: not his <hi>learning,</hi> (as <hi>Feſtus</hi> would have had it, v. 24.) ſuch a Zeal the carnal,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:92979:190"/>unbelieving Jews had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. Let Men be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo zealous in their way, if it be not God's way, their Zeal <hi>runs waſte.</hi> God is not honoured, but diſhonoured; not well pleaſed, but diſpleaſed with that Zeal, which is not according to his Word. To be zealous for what he hath not commanded, and much more, to be zealous for what he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; to be zealous againſt what he allows, and much more to be zealous againſt what he approves, and commandeth, is contrary to his Will, Intereſt, and Honour. This is not in a true account, Zeal <hi>for God,</hi> but rather againſt him. That Zeal, which is not according to knowledg, which is not guided, and warranted by the Word, hath an <hi>errour in the foundation.</hi> It hath nothing to difference it from the Zeal of the groſſeſt Idolaters in the World. A Papiſt may be heartily zealous in his way, zealous to promote his Religion, and gain Proſelytes to it, zealous againſt the ſoundeſt Chriſtians, crying out againſt ſuch, as dangerous Hereticks, wiſhing that they might come to their old work again, to burn ſuch as Hereticks. In this his Zeal he may follow his judgment, thinking he ſhould <hi>do God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> as Joh. 16.2. even in perſecuting the faithful to the death, if it was in his power, when (alas!) he is miſerably miſtaken. This will not juſtifie any in their Zeal for Idolatry, that they think God beſt ſerved, moſt honoured that way. This will not warrant any in their rage againſt the Saints, and Servants of the moſt High God, that they take them to be Hereticks, or Hypocrites. But they ſhall find, it was their duty to have informed themſelves better, and not to <hi>condemn the righteous,</hi> and not to <hi>call good evil.</hi> The Devil, that cannot
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:92979:191"/>endure, but is an utter enemy to right Zeal, is ready to promote a falſe, blind Zeal all he can. He is never weary of <hi>blowing this coal.</hi> This (he knows) would do him <hi>Knights ſervice.</hi> He cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch his beſt ſervants, who are zealous in his ſervice. Such do as much as can be, to <hi>credit his Cauſe,</hi> who put the honourable title of <hi>[Zeal for God]</hi> upon the ſervice they do his grand enemy. Such fight againſt God, while they carry his <hi>Colours.</hi> blind Zeal is a piece of the greateſt diſſervice to the intereſt of God, and Religion. Sometimes blind Zeal fights with a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> ſtrikes at a Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt; but letteth the enemy quietly paſs by. And which is worſe, it ſometimes falleth foul on thoſe whom it ought to defend. A Man acted with Blind Zeal is like one that <hi>ſhoots at Rovers,</hi> who is more likely to do miſchief than <hi>hit the Mark:</hi> or like one that fighteth <hi>blindfold,</hi> ſtriking Friends, as ſoon as Foes. What ſad havock, what woful work hath blind Zeal oft made in the Church? Even like <hi>a violent Fire,</hi> that getting head, layeth all waſte before it. The Devil has no <hi>ſtiffer prop</hi> to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Kingdom, and no fiercer engine of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or battering Ram to employ againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore let not any pleaſe themſelves in this, that they are <hi>Zealous</hi> in their way, when (perhaps) they are <hi>out of the way.</hi> And if ſo, the <hi>more haſte, the worſe ſpeed.</hi> Zeal in a falſe way caſts Men more behind. No Offering acceptable to God without Fire; yet to offer <hi>ſtrange-Fire</hi> here is very perillous. And that is not <hi>Fire from Heaven,</hi> where there is <hi>heat</hi> without <hi>Light.</hi> Where theſe go alone, either <hi>Heat without Light,</hi> (Zeal without Knowledg) or
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:92979:191"/>
               <hi>Light without Heat.</hi> (Knowledg without Zeal) it is ſadly ominous: but where they go together, very comfortable.</p>
            <p>Are you zealous? but who, and what are you zealous for? And what is your Zeal againſt? <hi>I have been very zealous for the Lord God of Hoſts;</hi> (ſays Elijah) <hi>becauſe the Children of Iſrael have forſaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars, and ſlain thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> &amp;c. 1 King. 19.14. Is thy Zeal againſt Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? So that thou canſt not indure to ſee God diſhonoured, his Worſhip neglected and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his Truth oppoſed, his Saints and Servants evil intreated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is thy Zeal for that which is good? Gal. 4.18. <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a good thing.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was very zealous before his Converſion, but <hi>of the traditions of his Fathers,</hi> Gal. 1.14. Many have a Zeal, but for their own fancies, and private opinions. Oh what pitty is it that <hi>ſuch ſpirits</hi> ſhould <hi>evaporate,</hi> and be loſt! Let a Man's Zeal be never ſo hearty, if the <hi>Mettal</hi> have not a <hi>right ſtamp,</hi> it is not <hi>currant.</hi>

            <p n="2">(2.) Right Zeal <hi>burns within,</hi> before it <hi>flames out.</hi> Hypocrites can be hot in their expreſſions, but are not <hi>fervent in ſpirit. Hot in the Mouth,</hi> but cold at
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:92979:192"/>Stomach, <hi>cold at Heart.</hi> Like <hi>Glow-worms,</hi> fiery in appearance, yet really cold in themſelves. Blind Zeal is <hi>ſtrange Fire;</hi> an hypocritical fained Zeal is <hi>falſe Fire.</hi> But true Zeal is not <hi>all in ſhew,</hi> though it will ſhew it ſelf. It lieth chiefly in the fervency and intention of the Spirit, and Affections. The <hi>life</hi> of Zeal is in <hi>the Heart.</hi> As when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Athens,</hi> ſeeing the City wholly given to Idolatry, <hi>his ſpirit</hi> was <hi>ſtirred</hi> in him, and this ſtirred him up to diſpute, and Preach againſt their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> hearers <hi>with their mouth ſhewed much love,</hi> (Ezek. 33.13.) it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that many in their outward expreſſions may ſhew much Zeal, declaming freely and often againſt the Sins of the Age, as the horrible increaſe of Prophaneneſs, growth of Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may ſeem to bewail the woful declining ſtate of true Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety amongſt us: but are our hearts deeply touched, and affected with the ſenſe of theſe things? Surely, that Zeal which is only <hi>from the teeth outward,</hi> is not true, but feigned.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) True Zeal hath reſpect to God, it <hi>pointeth</hi> towards God. As Fire aſcends. <hi>Sparks fly upwards.</hi> That is not right Zeal, which is flaſhy, vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in pretence for God; but really for ſelf. To pretend Zeal for the Lord, (as <hi>Jehu</hi> did) but real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſign, and aim at ſelf-applauſe, and ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, this is to mock God, or this is but to <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> him. And certainly, that God which ſearcheth the heart, will put a difference betwixt ſuch <hi>flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> and his <hi>true friends.</hi> They that have a true Zeal for God, will ordinarily <hi>prefer God</hi>'s <hi>Honour and Intereſt</hi> before their own concerns. True Zeal is accompanied with <hi>ſelf-denial.</hi> Such can be zealous
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:92979:192"/>for God, when they are like to ſuffer for their Zeal. They could better endure to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than that the Truth ſhould ſuffer. They could take it more patiently, to be reviled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to have <hi>their names caſt out as evil,</hi> than that the good wayes of God be <hi>evil ſpoken</hi> of.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) True Zeal will <hi>burn alone.</hi> As <hi>Elijah was zealous for the Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> even when he ſeemed to himſelf to be <hi>left alone,</hi> when he knew not of one, that would take his part, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.10. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> could not but expreſs his Zeal for God at <hi>Athens,</hi> when he had none to back him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>Come, ſee my Zeal for the Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Jehu,</hi> a Kings 10.16. An Hypocrite is not well pleaſed if he have not ſome to take notice of his Zeal, ſome that will applaud him for it. His Zeal in a good cauſe is ſoon <hi>cooled,</hi> if he have not ſome about him, ſuch as would encourage, and help to <hi>blow it up.</hi> Whereas true Zeal will burn ſtill, when there are none about it but ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>blow it out.</hi> As <hi>Lot's Soul was vexed from day to day</hi> (in Sodom) <hi>with their unlawful deeds,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. If a Zealous Chriſtian hath his lot caſt in a wicked prophane Place, or Family, even there will his Zeal be breaking forth. True Zeal will not be ſmothered, or put out with the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deadneſs of others about it; but rather uſeth to be more excited, and intended: As Fire burns hotteſt in cold froſty Weather.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) True Zeal is <hi>not Partial,</hi> but would appear for all that, wherein God's Honour and Intereſt lieth. It is as <hi>Extenſive,</hi> as ſincere and ſound Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. It is <hi>Quantitas intenſiva obedientiae,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dr. <hi>Ames.</hi> Thus to be <hi>Zealous of good works,</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:92979:193"/>in the <hi>whole kind</hi> of them, ready to promote any good Work, earneſtly deſirous to <hi>abound in every good Work,</hi> would ſhew our Zeal to be right. But a <hi>partial</hi> Zeal, as a partial Obedience, is not right. As <hi>partial heats</hi> in the Body are no ſigns of good Health. To be Zealous for <hi>works of Charity,</hi> but no friends of Holineſs, and true Piety: Or to ſeem forward for <hi>pious Exerciſes,</hi> but to be careleſs of other <hi>Moral Duties.</hi> To be negligent in the duties of our particular Callings, and Relations, cannot be right. True Zeal in a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> will make him active for God, as a Magiſtrate, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was. True Zeal in a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> will make him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the work of his Miniſtry. Like <hi>Apollos,</hi> who <hi>being fervent in Spirit, ſpake and taught diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the things of the Lord,</hi> Acts 18.25. True Zeal in the <hi>Maſter of a Family,</hi> will make him Induſtrious in his Place, To inſtruct his Houſhold in the Way of the Lord, and to engage them in God's Service; after <hi>Abraham</hi>'s example. Yea, one that is truly Zealous of good Works, will act <hi>uniformly:</hi> Not be hot in Prayer, Hearing, Conference; and Cold and Heartleſs, as to other Duties.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) True Zeal ſets <hi>againſt all Sin,</hi> as it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. This will cauſe ones Blood to riſe againſt Sin. So a Man will be ready to reprove, and ſhew his diſlike of Sin, as he has opportunity. So he will endeavour in his Place, according to his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to oppoſe Sin, to prevent, ſuppreſs it. True Zeal will make a Man an enemy to Sin, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he ſees it, whereſoever he meets with it. To appear very forward to condemn the faults of an Enemy, of ſuch as bear no good will to us; and to bear with Sin in our Friends, in ſuch as are
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:92979:193"/>nearly related to us, this is not right. True Zeal would make one like <hi>Levi,</hi> in God's Cauſe, <hi>Who ſaid unto his Father, and to his Mother, I have not ſeen him, neither did he acknowledg his Brethren, nor knew his own Children,</hi> (Deut. 33.9.) As <hi>Aſa</hi> would not bear with Idolatry in his own Mother, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16. In the trial of your <hi>Love,</hi> obſerve its working <hi>at a diſtance,</hi> as this will better appear, in its workings towards thoſe that are fartheſt off, in its being extended to Strangers, Enemies; than in its workings towards Friends, and Relations, that are near you. But in the trial of your <hi>Zeal,</hi> on the contrary, eſpecially obſerve how it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>near hand.</hi> To condemn Sin in others, but to indulge, and ſpare our own Sins, is not right, <q>Some are ſo Zealous againſt others Offences,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Adventu Dom. Ser.</hi> 4.</note> (as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays) that they might ſeem to hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, if they had the ſame judgment alſo of their own Sins: But now <hi>a weight, and a weight,</hi> (as he alludes) is an abomination to the Lord.</q> True Zeal would leaſt endure Sin in its <hi>own Territories.</hi> As Fire has moſt power on what is next it: Zeal where it is in truth, will be <hi>firing out</hi> ones own Corruptions. <hi>Like an Hearth of fire among Wood, and like a Torch of fire in a Sheaf.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>My Zeal hath conſumed me,</hi> Pſal. 119.139. So Zeal will be conſuming ones Luſts. Are we <hi>ſalted with this Fire,</hi> according to the expreſſion, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.49? A truly Zealous Chriſtian has the greateſt indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt his own Sins, and is moſt forward to take <hi>revenge</hi> on himſelf, and them, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.) And he would not ſpare one of his Sins. <hi>Jehu de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:92979:194"/>Baal out of Iſrael:</hi> yet this ſhewed his Zeal was not right, that <hi>he departed not from the ſins of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> he was ſtill for the <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> 2 Kings 10.28, 29. A reſolved indulgence, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any known Sin, and true Zeal, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) A right and regular Zeal is <hi>moſt vehement</hi> in the <hi>greateſt Matters.</hi> As Fire, the groſſer the ſubſtance that it takes hold,
<note place="margin">Ignis in mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria denſiori acriùs urit.</note> and feeds upon, the hotter it burns. True Zeal is more for plain and neceſſary Duties, than for any diſputable point, or matter of Controverſie. So likewiſe it riſeth againſt Sin, according to the quality, and aggravations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. What one noteth, to have always been the <hi>Hypocrites guiſe,</hi>

                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Downam, <hi>on Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note> is the <hi>genius</hi> of falſe Zeal, <hi>ſcil.</hi> 
               <q>To neglect the greater Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to affect the obſervation of the leſs, to prefer <hi>Circumſtances</hi> before the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and Ceremonies before the works either of Piety or Charity; to place the height of their Religion, either in obſerving, or urging Ceremonies, or contrariwiſe in inveighing againſt them.</q> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, to be more Zealous for, or againſt a <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> than for the weightieſt and moſt <hi>ſubſtantial Duties,</hi> or than againſt great and foul Enormities; to be more Zealous about ſome <hi>diſputable Point,</hi> and Opinion, (wherein ſound Chriſtians may have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent apprehenſions) than for main <hi>matters</hi> of Faith and Godlineſs, matters <hi>eſſential</hi> to true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, (wherein all that are Chriſtians indeed muſt agree, both as to Belief, and Practice) is no
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:92979:194"/>good ſign. You would not take him for a wiſe, and careful Builder, that laid the greateſt weight on the weakeſt part of the Wall: So it muſt be <hi>indiſcreet</hi> Zeal, or worſe than indiſcreet, which is more for unneceſſary Opinions, than for the moſt <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Duties, and <hi>fundamental</hi> Truths. Is that true Zeal for God? Or rather is it not a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Zeal, which is for ones own Opinions, neglecting thoſe things, which make moſt for the Honour of God, and wherein the <hi>main intereſt</hi> of Religion li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? Though many <hi>warm</hi> themſelves at theſe <hi>Sparks,</hi> many comfort themſelves that they are Zealous in their way, for their own Parties, and Opinions, yet in the end they may <hi>lie down in ſorrow</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, Would you not have us Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Truth, and in the Cauſe of God? Anſwer, 1. It concerns you to be well aſſured, that it is <hi>God's Truth</hi> you are Zealous for. How many that take their own private conceits for Divine Truths? 2. All Truths are not of <hi>equal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> And though the leaſt Truth may not be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,</hi> or oppoſed; yet leſſer Truths may be <hi>ſilenced,</hi> and concealed, when a Zealous contending for them would be to the wrong and prejudice of far greater and more neceſſary Matters. That is not to <hi>defend,</hi> but to betray the Intereſt of God, and his Truth, when Men care not <hi>perdere ſubſtantiam propter accidentia,</hi> to loſe the ſubſtance of Religion for Accidents, and Circumſtances. And that is <hi>Erratick</hi> Zeal, and Miſchievous, like <hi>Fire out of its place,</hi> when Men are ſo hot and earneſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about leſſer Points, that they themſelves neglect, and do what in them lieth to hinder
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:92979:195"/>others minding the <hi>main of Religion.</hi> Zeal (like Fire) in its proper place, is of great uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: But out of its place, very dangerous and deſtructive. And remember, Sirs, that true Zeal for God, is moſt for thoſe Truths, and Duties, wherein the great intereſt of Religion lieth: And is moſt againſt ſuch things, whereby God is moſt diſhonoured, the Goſpel obſtructed, Religion moſt wronged, diſcredited, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">(8.) Right <hi>Zeal</hi> is joyned with Chriſtian <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> is for Chriſtian Concord. One of a truly zealous Spirit, is alſo of an healing, <hi>cloſing Spirit:</hi> is of a <hi>publick Spirit.</hi> Right Zeal is more for the <hi>common intereſt</hi> of Religion, than for <hi>private</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. It is no <hi>Firebrand,</hi> no <hi>Incendiary</hi> in the Church. It is moved at what it ſees amiſs, it is for Reformation; but will not hurry Men upon diſorderly actings in their paſſionate ſenſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. It is againſt <hi>extreams</hi> on both Hands. Paſſionate Tranſports, and raſh heady Courſes, are not the effects of an <hi>holy,</hi> but of a <hi>bitter Zeal.</hi> Right Zeal keepeth within due compaſs. It is for <hi>Edification,</hi> not for <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> It is for Peace and Unity. It is for Sodering and Cementing, not for Separating ſuch as ſhould Joyn. As Fire, though it <hi>ſeparate Heterogenials, congregates Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genials:</hi> Yea, it will melt divers Metals into one Lump. True Zeal is not for <hi>perverſe Diſputings,</hi> tending to Strife; but for <hi>godly Edifying in Faith.</hi> It is not for kindling Diſſentions, or cauſing Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and Diviſions amongſt Chriſtians; but is moved with great Grief at the ſight of ſuch things. (As the Apoſtle, <hi>Who is offended, and I burn not?</hi>) It is for <hi>maintaining</hi> the <hi>unity of the Spirit in the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:92979:195"/>bond of Peace.</hi> And they that are more zealous to maintain ſome <hi>By-opinions,</hi> than to maintain Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion with their Fellow-Chriſtians, are quite <hi>beſides the Mark.</hi> The Churches Peace, and Edifying one another in Love, are far greater Matters, than any unneceſſary Opinions, which too many too zealouſly contend for. Yea, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary,</hi> is too good a word for ſome of them; I ſhould have ſaid, <hi>unſound Opinions.</hi> O that the Guilty here would ſeriouſly conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not be more for the Honour of God, the Credit, and Intereſt of the Goſpel, and the ſecuring of true Religion amongſt us, to joyn with their Fellow-Chriſtians, ſo far as they can, to hold together, to their mutual help, ſtrengthening, and encouragement; than to be ſo hot for their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which if they were <hi>true,</hi> yet are far <hi>remote from the Foundation,</hi> and ſo far from being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, that not one of hundreds that are ſaved, and now in Heaven, was ever of their Way and Opinion here. To be ſo <hi>rigid in their Way,</hi> to carry, as if all were unfit, and unworthy for them to hold Chriſtian Communion with, that come not over to ſuch Opinions of theirs; alas! this is <hi>Wild-fire,</hi> not true Spiritual Zeal. And verily, I cannot think of any thing, that will probably more harden, and encourage <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this Day, than the ſad Rents and Diſſentions amongſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> As he ſaid, <hi>Is not the hand of</hi> Joab <hi>in all this?</hi> So it is probable enough, the Heads of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> have been in this. <hi>Divide, &amp; impera.</hi> They know, a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, is not likely to ſtand long; and hope to raiſe themſelves on our Ruines.</p>
            <pb n="374" facs="tcp:92979:196"/>
            <p n="9">(9.) That is right Zeal, when we are more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with <hi>Indignities</hi> offered unto God, than with any <hi>Injuries</hi> done to our ſelves. When we are more zealous in <hi>God's Cauſe,</hi> than in <hi>our own.</hi> We find, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.1, 2. Miriam <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>yet he</hi> ſeemed not at all concerned for himſelf: We find not any reply that he made. He was <hi>meek in his own cauſe.</hi> Whereas upon ſight of the Peoples Impiety, their Idolatry, in the Cauſe of God he was preſently <hi>all on a flame.</hi> His <hi>anger waxed hot,</hi> Exod. 32.19. To be mild in our own cauſe, but zealous in God's, is a ſign, that we are indeed zealous for God. As it is a ſign of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when we are remiſs as can be, unmoved, unleſs when our own Intereſt is wrapt together with God's Intereſt. As moſt Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can bear it well enough though Children fail never ſo groſly in reſpect of the Duty that they owe to God, though Servants plainly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and contemn God's Service; They can bear with their Impiety, with their taking God's Name in vain, with the prophaning of his Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet many times they are <hi>all Fire and Tow,</hi> if ſuch do but fail in point of good Manners to them, if they be not very obſervant of them, and their commands. Now it is true, the leaſt Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards Parents, and ſo negligence in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, are Sins againſt God. But if upon that account you are moſt moved, and diſpleaſed, then you will be diſpleaſed at other Sins as well; and more diſpleaſed at greater Sins, than you are at theſe. You will be <hi>zealous for God,</hi> when <hi>Self</hi> is not ſo much concerned.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) Right Zeal for God is joyned with <hi>real
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:92979:196"/>Love,</hi> and <hi>true compaſſion</hi> towards Men, towards Sinners. Thus while we hate their <hi>Sins,</hi> we ſhould yet love, and heartily wiſh well to their <hi>Perſons.</hi> While we cannot <hi>bear with them that are evil,</hi> in that which is evil; yet we ſhould be glad to do them good, and glad indeed, if by any means we might be helping to make them better. As great Enemies as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to the Goſpel, and to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he could not but pity them, and his <hi>hearts deſire and prayer to God</hi> was for them, that <hi>they might be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.1. Zeal againſt Sinners hath <hi>anger, and grief</hi> in it; not hatred. As in the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. True Zeal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires their Converſion, rather than Confuſion: And would rejoyce more in their Reformation, than in their Ruine. Our Saviour checked the <hi>furious Zeal</hi> of the Diſciples, when they would fain have been <hi>calling down Fire from Heaven,</hi> to conſume thoſe poor Creatures that would not receive him. <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of,</hi> Luke 9.54, 55. They were too haſty: at that time a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Revenge</hi> was ſtirring in them, which was not <hi>Elias</hi>'s ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) True Zeal is <hi>for expedition</hi> in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. As <hi>Phinehas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ignis eſt maxime actuoſus, &amp; maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè mobilis.</note> who was zealous for God could not <hi>ſit ſtill,</hi> when he ſaw God ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſhonoured, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. <hi>Then ſtood up Phinehas,</hi> and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Judgment. <hi>[Then ſtood up Phinehas.]</hi> The word may import his <hi>readineſs,</hi> and <hi>forwardneſs</hi> to appear for God againſt Sin, as occaſion was then offered. So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> teſtified againſt the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that had lodged but once or twice without
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:92979:197"/>Jeruſalem under the Wall on the Sabbath, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to clap them up. If they <hi>did ſo again,</hi> he <hi>would lay hands on them,</hi> Neh. 13.20, 21. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 101.8. <hi>I will early deſtroy all the wicked.</hi> Though it may point at the uſual time of ſitting in Judgment, <hi>in the morning;</hi> yet withal it may import, that he would not be delatory in the work. Thus Zeal will ſet Men <hi>early</hi> on work for God, will make Men quick and ſpeedy in giving check to Sin, as they have power, and opportunity to put a ſtop to it as ſoon as they can. Sinful ſluggiſh demurs, delays, <hi>put-offs,</hi> are contrary to the nature of true Zeal. So a liſtleſneſs to Duty, is no ſign of Zeal. It is <hi>cold</hi> that <hi>benummeth.</hi> So it is a ſign of the want of Zeal, a ſign of extream coldneſs, when we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find our hands,</hi> to turn them to any good work, when we are like the ſlothful, (Prov. 19.24.) that <hi>hides his hand in his boſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">(12.) True Zeal makes ſouls, as forward unto, ſo free, and lively in God's ſervice. What a Man does zealouſly, he does very heartily. To be <hi>zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of good Works,</hi> is not barely to do ſome good Works, but it further implieth earneſtneſs, alacrity, and <hi>fervency of ſpirit</hi> in the doing of Good Works. To <hi>pray with Zeal,</hi> is more than <hi>ſaying a Prayer:</hi> it is no leſs than to be <hi>fervent in Prayer,</hi> to pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To be zealous in works of Charity, is not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give to ſuch that ſtand in need; but to give willingly and freely, Like thoſe of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> (2 Cor. 8.3.) that <hi>were willing of themſelves:</hi> That needed no ſpurring on. What the Apoſtle ſayes of <hi>Love,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4. It is <hi>kind,</hi> bountiful; this may well be ſaid of <hi>Zeal,</hi> which is the <hi>fervour of Love.</hi> Zeal is bountiful; at leaſt in <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>deſire.</hi> Cold has a
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:92979:197"/>
               <hi>condenſing,</hi> and contracting quality: but <hi>heat rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,</hi> and extends. So Zeal in the Heart <hi>enlarges</hi> it. A zealous Chriſtian would not ſerve God at an <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rate,</hi> he deſires to <hi>abound in the work of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>flame</hi> will be mounting upwards: A zealous ſpirit is a <hi>raiſed ſpirit,</hi> raiſed in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But a cold dead heart is ſtill bearing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. We read of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> that <hi>his heart was lifted up in the wayes of the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.6. So one of a zealous ſpirit never thinks he does enough for God. He will deſire ſtill to ſerve him more, and to ſerve him better.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) True Zeal <hi>gives courage</hi> in the Cauſe of God, filleth the Soul full of reſolution for God. And indeed that may be the meaning of <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat's heart being lifted up in the wayes of the Lord.</hi> A <hi>zealous</hi> Spirit is a <hi>magnanimous</hi> Spirit. An holy Zeal is indeed <hi>Cos fortitudinis,</hi> the <hi>Whetſtone of Valour.</hi> As <hi>Eſther's</hi> Zeal for God, and his People, put courage into her, (though ſhe might naturally be timorous, as is common to her Sex.) What an <hi>heroick reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was there, Eſth. 4.16. <hi>I will go in unto the King; and if I periſh, I periſh.</hi> If we have no Spirit, no Courage, to appear for God, his Truth, and Wayes, ſure, we have no Zeal forthem. Indeed of all things Sinners are moſt offended at holy Zeal. They that have nothing to ſay againſt Chriſtian Meekneſs, or Charitableneſs, and ſome other Graces; yet can ill endure the heat of Godly Zeal. O it is ſcorching, and tormenting to them! Here they are ready to cry out <hi>Fire, fire,</hi> as one ſays. This oft puts them into a great combuſtion. Yet true Zeal will break thorow oppoſition. <hi>Many Waters cannot quench Love, neither can the Floods drown it.</hi> The like may
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:92979:198"/>be ſaid of Zeal. It is not quenched, or cooled; but oft more intended and increaſed, when others would diſcourage it.</p>
            <p n="14">(14.) True Zeal, that is a cauſe of ſuch courage and reſolution for God, that giveth confidence and boldneſs before Men, yet is joyned with <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Holy Fear</hi> and Trembling before God. One gracious diſpoſition is not contrary to another. And true Zeal is not <hi>blown up</hi> with high thoughts of ones ſelf, but with <hi>high thoughts of God.</hi> The Dread and Reverence of the <hi>moſt High,</hi> of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Glorious and Holy Majeſty, promotes true Zeal for God; helpeth to <hi>ſet an edge</hi> upon it, and <hi>ſteeleth</hi> the Soul with an holy boldneſs, <hi>hardeneth</hi> it againſt a baſe carnal fear of Man.
<note place="margin">Mr. Vines.</note> But it is not right, when (as one ſays) Zeal that ſhould <hi>eat us up,</hi> is <hi>eaten</hi> up of Pride.</p>
            <p n="15">(15.) Right regular Zeal will more diſpoſe, and fit us for our Work and Duty; not take off from Duty, or tranſport into Sin. That is not Zeal, but <hi>diſtempered Paſſion;</hi> it is not from Grace, but from the workings of Corruption, when we are <hi>diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> and unhinged,</p>
            <p n="16">(16.) If we have true Zeal for God, it will be <hi>a joy</hi> to us, to ſee any zealous and active for God. As on the other hand it will be our great grief, to ſee Men generally cold, indifferent, lukewarm in Religion. To ſee others regardleſs of God, and of the intereſt of true Religion, will move our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and indignation. But it will not offend us, to ſee any acted with <hi>regular Zeal</hi> for God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Apoſtle did, and would <hi>rejoyce, that Chriſt was Preached,</hi> though ſome preached Chriſt <hi>out of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:92979:198"/>envy,</hi> Phil. 1.15, 18. How much more would he have rejoyced, to have ſeen as good proof and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their <hi>pure Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> as he ſaw of their <hi>Envy,</hi> carrying them out in the work. If we are truly zealous for God, we ſhall be taken with thoſe whom we ſee, or hear to be zealous for him, our <hi>hearts will be towards</hi> ſuch, yea <hi>knit to</hi> them (as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi> was to <hi>David.</hi>) And we ſhall bleſs God for ſuch. As <hi>Deborah,</hi> Judg. 5.9. <hi>My heart is towards the Governours of Iſrael, that offered themſelves willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the People: Bleſs the Lord.</hi> She deſired that the Lord might be praiſed, that put ſuch a ſpirit into them. If others <hi>out-ſhine</hi> us here, yet if we have true Zeal for God, we ſhall be ſo far from <hi>envying</hi> them, that the more zealous any are, the more we ſhall <hi>honour</hi> and be taken with them.</p>
            <p n="17">(17.) If we are truly zealous, we have an <hi>holy emulation,</hi> a deſire to follow, yea, if it might be, to outſtrip thoſe that excel in vertue. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 Cor. 14.12. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye are zealous of ſpiritual gifts, ſeek that ye may excel.</hi>—As the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians Zeal</hi> and forwardneſs <hi>provoked very many,</hi> 2 Cor 9.2. We ſhould not <hi>envy</hi> ſuch as have got the ſtart of us; and yet ſhould (in a good ſenſe) <hi>emulate</hi> them. We ſhould ſtrive at leaſt to overtake thoſe that are foremoſt. Yea, true Zeal for God and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will not ſet it ſelf any bounds or limits. You cannot call them zealous that ſtint themſelves, and count it an high point of prudence and diſcretion, not to be too forward in Religion. But as <hi>Love,</hi> ſo <hi>Zeal</hi> is like <hi>Fire,</hi> that cannot be hid, it will break forth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>—Quis enim celaverit ignem,</hi>

            </q>
            <pb n="380" facs="tcp:92979:199"/>
            <p>Such as are afraid of being <hi>counted zealous,</hi> as if it was a matter of <hi>diſgrace,</hi> are far from ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>David</hi> had, who when he was mocked, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed of <hi>Michal,</hi> ſpake reſolvedly, <hi>I will yet be more vile than thus, (if this be to be vile.) Fire</hi> is one of thoſe things, which <hi>ſay not, It is enough.</hi> (Prov. 30.16.) So true Zeal never ſays, <hi>It is enough.</hi> A zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Chriſtian would have more Grace, more Zeal for God. They that are zealous of good works, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to abound more and more in good works.</p>
            <p n="18">(18.) True Zeal is not for a ſpurt, for <hi>a flaſh,</hi> it is conſtant, a <hi>Fire that never goes out.</hi> Like that Fire upon the Altar, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.13. Though I muſt grant, the Zeal of a true Chriſtian doth not <hi>flame up</hi> at all times alike; yet it is never <hi>totally</hi> extinguiſhed. It <hi>is good to be zealouſly affected [always] in a good thing,</hi> Gal. 4.18. And this is a good ſign, thy Zeal is right, if it be conſtant. There are ſome whoſe Zeal is but a <hi>flaſh,</hi> ſcarce any ſooner <hi>in,</hi> than <hi>out</hi> again. Some have a <hi>burning fit</hi> of Zeal for a while, that is quickly over. Their <hi>praeter-natural</hi> heat ſtays not. But true Zeal is like the <hi>natural heat</hi> of the Body, that continues as long as one lives. Yea, though it is like <hi>Fire in green wood,</hi> ſubject to go out if it be not blown up; yet that Spirit which firſt kindled this ſpark in Believers, is given to <hi>dwell</hi> in them, and to <hi>abide</hi> with them for ever. And therefore though there may be ſome decays of Holy Zeal for a time; yet it is <hi>ſtirred up</hi> again in the Faithful; and uſually burneth clearer after it is recovered: As we ſometimes ſee Fire blaze up more, after a daſh of water caſt on it. Yea, ordinarily (as we may obſerve a flame mount higheſt, before it goes out:) ordinarily I ſay, a Chriſtians Zeal is moſt
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:92979:199"/>raiſed, the nearer he is to his <hi>end.</hi> But ſuch as once ſeemed very forward for that which is good, but are quite fallen off again, have quite <hi>out-lived their Zeal,</hi> they even give others cauſe enough to ſuſpect, that they were never ſound.</p>

            <p>TO go on to the Trial of all other Chriſtian Vertues, (might upon ſome accounts) croſs my deſign in what is Written, which is, to help and direct ordinary Chriſtians in the Trial, and exerciſe of Grace, even ſuch as cannot purchaſe, or have not time to peruſe large Volums.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken of the chief <hi>Cardinal Graces,</hi> and ſhewed how they work, how they may be known. Prove theſe in your ſelves, and there is no queſtion,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:92979:200"/>but you have the whole <hi>Train of thoſe better things, that</hi> neceſſarily <hi>accompany Salvation.</hi> As without theſe, any other Vertues you may ſeem to have, as <hi>Temperance, Patience, Meekneſs,</hi> &amp;c. are but Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and Counterfeits: So that I might make a Full-ſtop at what is Written.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe many are kept off from any ſerious <hi>examination</hi> of their Eſtates, ſatisfying themſelves with this, That they have <hi>Hopes;</hi> and ſome, That they have <hi>Joys</hi> too; never enquiring, How they came by them, or of what kind they are: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before I conclude this Treatiſe, I ſhall ſhew you how you may know, whether your Hope, and Joy be ſound or no.</p>
            <p>And firſt of <hi>Hope.</hi> —</p>
            <p>But let me premiſe theſe Three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is unqueſtionable, that there is a <hi>falſe,</hi> a deceiving Hope, as well as a <hi>true,</hi> and certain Hope. There is a <hi>dead</hi> Hope, as well as a lively Hope. There is a <hi>confounding</hi> Hope, as well as an Hope <hi>that maketh not aſhamed.</hi> There is the <hi>Hope of the Hypocrite,</hi> (Job 8.13.) as well as the <hi>Hope of the Righteous,</hi> (Prov. 10.28.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. Better <hi>no Hopes,</hi> than <hi>falſe Hopes.</hi> As we may allude to that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Seeſt thou a Man wiſe in his own conceit? There is more hope of a Fool than of him.</hi> So there is <hi>more Hope</hi> of Sinners that are moſt deſpondent, in one ſenſe <hi>without Hope;</hi> than of ſuch as are very confident, <hi>high in their Hopes,</hi> but without any ground. And how ſad is it (as I remember one ſays) to ſail on ſmoothly to Hell, having Heaven all the while in view? Hope, that is like to end in horrour and utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, is not worth having.</p>
            <pb n="383" facs="tcp:92979:200"/>
            <p n="3">3. It is juſtly to be ſuſpected, that their Hopes are groundleſs, and falſe, who are unwilling to bring them to the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and Trial. That part of a Man's Body which he could not endure to have touched, we would conclude not right, or ſound. But if your Hope be right, it would not ſuffer any injury, or damage, by a fair impartial Trial, but be more confirmed.</p>
            <p>Now if you ask, What is Chriſtian Hope? I anſwer, It is a <hi>longing,</hi> and <hi>fiducial expectation</hi> of Good promiſed, to come in God's Time, and Way. Faith and Hope are very <hi>near akin.</hi> Yet thus they differ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In Order.</hi> Faith <hi>in order of nature</hi> is before Hope. Hope is the Daughter, at leaſt the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Siſter of Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Object.</hi> Faith has reſpect to the <hi>whole Word</hi> of God: Hope to the <hi>Word of Promiſe. Good</hi> only is the object of Hope. And <hi>Future Good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quod ſperatur, non poſſidetur.</note> good to be received and enjoyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. Or if I may be ſaid to hope, that I am in a ſtate of Grace, that my Sins are pardoned, which is hope of a preſent Good, if my Hope be ſound; or if I ſay, I hope God heard my prayer at ſuch a time, and gave in ſuch a Mercy in anſwer to it; here ſeems to be Hope of a thing paſt. Here the word <hi>[Hope]</hi> ſeems to be uſed more <hi>improperly,</hi> or taken more <hi>largely.</hi> It is more properly, a Perſwaſion, though ſhort of full Perſwaſion, or Aſſurance. But <hi>properly</hi> Hope looks at Good to come. Whereas what is paſt may be the <hi>object</hi> of Faith, as well as what is to come. As we <hi>believe</hi> the Creation of the World, a <hi>thing
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:92979:201"/>paſt;</hi> as well as the Reſurrection of the Body, which is <hi>future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In their proper <hi>formal Acts.</hi> Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, and aſſents to <hi>the truth of the Promiſes,</hi> Hope expects and looks for the <hi>Good promiſed.</hi> An <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Good,</hi> is the <hi>formal Act</hi> of Hope. And herein alſo it is differenced from, or contrary to <hi>Fear,</hi> which is an <hi>expectation of Evil,</hi> not of Good.</p>
            <p>But that which I mainly intend, is, to ſhew, wherein <hi>ſound Hope</hi> differs from <hi>Preſumption,</hi> or from a falſe Hope? Or how we may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Hope be ſound?</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) True hope is not ordinarily obtained, but after ſad doubts and fears. As it is, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14, 15. God uſeth to bring his People <hi>into the Wilderneſs,</hi> before he ſpeaketh comfortably to them. He makes the <hi>Valley of</hi> Achor <hi>a door of Hope.</hi> As in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their outward Condition, he ſuffers them many times to be brought into great Straits, and Troubles, before he gives Enlargements, and works Deliverance for them. So in reference to their Spiritual Eſtates, they are brought <hi>into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſee themſelves <hi>loſt,</hi> and are full of trouble, (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were by <hi>Achan</hi>'s means, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.24, 25, 26.) before Hope comes in.
<note place="margin">Tarnov. in M. <hi>Pol.</hi> Synop.</note> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t illa perturbatio in gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium converſa eſt; ita triſtitia ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Deum ſpem parit.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> uſeth to go before the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.15. As it is, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.29. He <hi>putteth his Mouth in the Duſt, if ſo there may be Hope.</hi> It is the common Order, and Method of God's Grace and Spirit, to caſt down before a lifting up.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:92979:201"/>uſually Souls are laid low even in the duſt, before they are raiſed to a lively Hope.</p>
            <p>Such as will tell us <hi>they hope well,</hi> and <hi>never doubted of their Salvation in all their lives,</hi> ſuch as were never humbled, never made ſenſible how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable they are by nature, how obnoxious to God's Wrath, how liable to everlaſting Condemnation, we have Reaſon enough to conclude, they have not a ſound Hope. Their <hi>confident ſpirit</hi> muſt be <hi>broken,</hi> before it be <hi>ſet right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Sound Hope is <hi>a fruit of the Spirit.</hi> Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is natural to Sinners, they have it of themſelves. Or if they have their Conſciences awakened, their Eyes opened to ſee their Sin and Miſery; then they are more prone to entertain hard and black thoughts of God, than <hi>to hope</hi> aright <hi>in his Mercy.</hi> Like thoſe that ſaid, <hi>There is no Hope.</hi> Our <hi>Hope is loſt, we are cut off for our parts.</hi> It is the mighty work of the Spirit to raiſe up Souls to <hi>a lively Hope:</hi> who had <hi>received the ſentence of Death in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>That ye may abound in Hope through the power of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Gal. 5.5. <hi>We through the Spirit wait for the Hope of Righteouſneſs by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now have ſuch any ground to think the Hope they have, is the <hi>fruit</hi> and work <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> who may know they <hi>have not the Spirit;</hi> who are <hi>not led by,</hi> neither <hi>walk after the Spirit,</hi> who will not follow the motions of the Spirit; who are ſo deſperately wicked as even to ſcoff at the operation of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Sound Hope is an <hi>Hope in God through Chriſt, according to his Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On what is our Hope bottomed? The ground and foundation of true Hope is <hi>in God,</hi> not in creatures, nor in our ſelves. It is <hi>Hope towards God,</hi>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:92979:202"/>Act. 24.15. As our <hi>Faith</hi> and Truſt muſt be <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated on God</hi> only, ſo our <hi>Hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.21. we muſt look to God as the <hi>Author</hi> of all Good. We muſt not expect any good from others, as the <hi>Authors,</hi> or original; but only as <hi>means,</hi> or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Pſal 39.7. <hi>Now Lord what wait I for? My Hope is in thee.</hi> It is <hi>a peice of Idolatry,</hi> to make Gold our Hope, Job. 31.24. we may not look for ſo much as any temporal benefit from means, wealth, friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without God. <hi>All our expectation muſt be from him,</hi> Pſal. 62.5.</p>
            <p>But further, True Hope is bottom'd upon God <hi>in and through Chriſt.</hi> Therefore it is called, <hi>Hope in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. 1 Theſ. 1.3. There is no Hope for Sinners, that a moſt Juſt and Holy God ſhould be favourable, and propitious toward them, but <hi>in and through Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>We are begotten again to a lively Hope, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> — proving God's Juſtice ſatisfied, and the enemies of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation vanquiſhed by him. But without Chriſt, we were <hi>without Hope.</hi> So if we be ſtrangers to Chriſt, we are ſtrangers to true Hope.</p>
            <p>And yet further, True Hope is bottom'd on God, in Chriſt, <hi>according to his Word.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt oft profeſſeth his Hope in God's Word. That is not a ſound Hope, which is not a <hi>Scripture Hope.</hi> That Hope which is not built on God's Promiſes, which is not warranted by his Word, will fail Men in the end. It is <hi>groundleſs</hi> Preſumption.</p>
            <p>Now how many whoſe Hope is built on God's <hi>Providence,</hi> and their preſent outward Proſperity, without any word of promiſe to ſupport it. They <hi>hope God loves</hi> them, becauſe they proſper in the World. But the Word tells us, <hi>All things come alike
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:92979:202"/>to all here; that no Man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.1, 2.</p>
            <p>The Hope of many is grounded on God's <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and their preſent impunity, <hi>Becauſe Sentence is not ſpeedily executed.</hi> But forbearance is no acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Do we not read, that though <hi>the Lord is ſlow to anger;</hi> yet <hi>he will not acquit the wicked,</hi> Nah. 1.3. And <hi>God endureth with much long-ſuffering the Veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, on whom</hi> yet at laſt <hi>he will ſhew his Wrath, and make his Power known,</hi> Rom. 9.22.</p>
            <p>Many build their Hopes on God's <hi>general Goodneſs</hi> to his Creatures. That becauſe <hi>he made them,</hi> he will <hi>ſave</hi> them. Though the Lord by his Prophet hath told them the contrary, Iſa. 27.11. <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding: therefore he that made them will have no mercy on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Hope in this that they are not ſo bad as others. They are neither Extortioners, nor Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, nor Adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is evident in the Word, that the <hi>higheſt degree of Morality,</hi> and Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not ſerve any Mans turn. That <hi>except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3. That <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>
            <p>Some build their Hopes on <hi>a form of Godlineſs,</hi> and an outward ſhew of Holineſs. But without the truth of Grace in the heart, and without the Life and Power of Godlineſs, all Men do in Religion is done <hi>in Hypocriſie.</hi> So, what may be <hi>highly eſteemed</hi> among Men, may be of no account, yea, may be <hi>abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> Luk. 16.15. And what will be the <hi>Hypocrites portion</hi> at laſt, the Word plainly tells you.</p>
            <p>Some build their Hopes on their own <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:92979:203"/>and <hi>Merits,</hi> conceiting they deſerve highly of God for what they have done. <hi>Peter Lombart</hi> ſays,

               <q>That to hope for any thing without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent merits, cannot be called Hope, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</q> Yet to do him right, immediately before he joyns the <hi>Grace of God</hi> with thoſe merits, of which he ſpeaks. And otherwiſe if by merits are underſtood, <hi>proper Legal merits,</hi> it were <hi>Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> for the beſt Men in the World to expect any thing this way from God. The beſt of God's Saints muſt acknowledg, with <hi>Jacob,</hi> that they are <hi>leſs than the leaſt of God's Mercies.</hi> That which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers hope for, comes by way of <hi>free gift,</hi> it is not <hi>of debt.</hi> Eternal Life is the <hi>gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6.23. <hi>The gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So Believers are to <hi>hope for the Grace that is to be brought unto them at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.13. They are to <hi>look for the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal Life,</hi> Jud. v. 21. They that are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of themſelves, and their own works, build on a <hi>ſandy foundation,</hi> lean on a roten prop.</p>
            <p>And yet there is <hi>preparing Grace,</hi> ſuch as God hath made the <hi>condition</hi> of the Promiſe, a futable qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and diſpoſition of the ſubject, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure fitting for the Mercy promiſed, the Good to be received.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:92979:203"/>after the <hi>condition upon which</hi> the Mercy hoped for is promiſed, this is not ſound Hope in God, it is a raſh and falſe Hope; It has no bottom in the Word.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) True Hope as it is an <hi>Hope in God,</hi> ſo it is an <hi>hoping for</hi> him. A Believers Hope looks chiefly at God, as the <hi>beſt Object</hi> he can hope for, as he is the <hi>chiefeſt Good.</hi> As he <hi>acteth for God,</hi> and ſuffers for God; ſo he longeth, waiteth, <hi>hopeth for God.</hi> And methinks that expreſſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.15. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>having Hope towards God,</hi> looks this way. So when God is ſaid to be his Peoples <hi>Hope;</hi>

As Chriſt is called <hi>our Hope.</hi> The enjoyment of God in Chriſt is <hi>the top</hi> of a Believer's hopes. As the Pſalmiſt ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee? and there is none upon the Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Hope of others uſeth not to riſe ſo high. Their deſires indeed are not this way. <hi>Gold</hi> is the Worldling's <hi>Hope,</hi> rather than God. The <hi>praiſe of Men</hi> is the Hypocrites Hope, rather than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Fruition of God. The <hi>Heaven</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, unſanctified Hearts dream of, and hope for, is not <hi>the true Happineſs</hi> in a <hi>full Conformity</hi> to God, and full <hi>Fruition</hi> of him; but an <hi>imaginary</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a meer freedom from ſuch Miſeries as they are ſenſible of here, and a Life of perpetual eaſe, and pleaſure, abſtracted from the other.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Sound Hope</hi> in God, is accompanied with an <hi>holy fear</hi> of him. Pſal. 33.18. <hi>Behold the Eye
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:92979:204"/>of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mercy.</hi> Pſal. 147.11. <hi>The Lord takes pleaſure in them.</hi> — None hope aright in his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but ſuch as truly fear him. Pſal. 118.4. <hi>Let them that fear the Lord, ſay, that his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Luke 1.50. <hi>His Mercy is on them that fear him, from Generation to Generation.</hi> Pſal. 85.9. <hi>Surely his Salvation is nigh them that fear him.</hi> But ſuch as are void of God's Fear, are without any true ſolid ground of Hope, in their preſent State. <q>Some (as Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> noteth) have neither <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> nor <hi>Fear,</hi> as Atheiſts; others have ſome <hi>Fear,</hi> but no <hi>Hope,</hi> as Devils and deſperate Men; others have ſome <hi>Hope,</hi> but no <hi>Fear,</hi> as preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men. But they that have <hi>Hope, and Fear</hi> mingled with it, may rather hope that their Hope is ſound.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Sound Hope is accompanied with <hi>ſound Obedience.</hi> Pſal. 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandments.</hi> And ver. 80. <hi>Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes, that I be not aſhamed.</hi> And ver. 166. <hi>Lord, I have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for thy Salvation, and done thy Commandments.</hi> Heb. 10.35, 36. <hi>Caſt not away your Confidence,— that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Promiſe.</hi> But it is a vain Confidence, to expect the good of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> without obſerving the <hi>Command.</hi> There <hi>is no peace to the Wicked.</hi> That is a falſe Hope, which is maintained with a plain neglect of Duty, and a bold adventuring upon Sin. Prov. 10.28. <hi>The hope of the Righteous ſhall be Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But the expectation of the Wicked ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) True Hope is not maintained but by <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> and <hi>Watchfulneſs.</hi> It is contrary to Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:92979:204"/>and Security. 1 Pet. 1.13. <hi>Wherefore gird up the loins of your Mind, be ſober, and hope to the end,</hi> or hope <hi>perfectly,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Integre,</hi> Hope ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A dull, ſtupifying Hope, ſuch Hope as inclines to a drowſie frame, is not a ſound Hope; neither will it hold long. Such as are <hi>lulled aſleep</hi> with their Hopes, ſhall be <hi>awaked</hi> again with Terrors. True Hope, is a <hi>Lively Hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. A dead Man in true account, is not a Man: So a dead Hope, is not true Hope. The Devil never envies Men ſuch Hope, as makes them remiſs, and careleſs.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) A true Hope of Happineſs, is a great help to a progreſs in Grace and Holineſs. Though Hope is compared to an <hi>Anchor</hi> that ſtays the Ship; yet here <hi>Non remorae, ſed calcaris inſtar eſt:</hi> It is no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora,</hi> but a ſpur in a way of Duty. As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorteth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe Promiſes (dearly Beloved) let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh, and Spirit, perfecting Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of God.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> lays down this Note moſt plainly, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Every man that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi> A lively Hope of Heaven will quicken us in Heavens way. That we ſhall follow after Holineſs, that we may be <hi>made meet for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in light.</hi> True Hope promotes Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) Sound Hope produces <hi>Patience.</hi> As we read of <hi>Patience of Hope,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.3. Remembring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing <hi>your—Patience of Hope.</hi> Though we read of <hi>Patience</hi> working <hi>Experience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Perer. <hi>in</hi> Pol. <hi>Synopſ.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Experience Hope,</hi> Rom. 5.4. yet as one no teth, <hi>Spes patientem praecedit, ſed ſpem hîc vocat Spei robur, &amp;c.</hi> Hope precedes Patience;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:92979:205"/>but here he ſpeaks of Hope improved, and <hi>grown up.</hi> Patience and Experience add to the ſtrength and firmneſs of Hope. But without Hope, Patience could not ſubſiſt. There is <hi>Patience in expecting fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good</hi> and happineſs, (Rom. 8.25) And this is as I may ſay, the <hi>elicit act</hi> of Chriſtian Hope. Again, there is <hi>Patience in bearing preſent evils,</hi> and miſeries: and this is (as it were) the <hi>imperate Act</hi> of Hope. That is not a good Hope, which makes us no fitter to bear evils here. As Hope may be called the Daughter of Faith; ſo <hi>Patience</hi> the <hi>Daughter of Hope.</hi> Hope is compared to an <hi>Helmet,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.8. And <hi>for an Helmet</hi> the <hi>Hope of Salvation.</hi> This would help on to bear furious blows. Again, it is compared to an <hi>Anchor,</hi> Heb. 6.19. <hi>which Hope we have as an Anchor of the Soul both ſure, and ſteadfaſt.</hi> This Anchor would ſtay one in tempeſtuous Waves, and boiſtrous Storms.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) Sound Hope will give Courage, will put a Man in heart, and make him reſolved for God. A true Chriſtian, to maintain his <hi>Hope</hi> will not care to quit <hi>preſent</hi> worldly <hi>Poſſeſſions.</hi> If we could be perſwaded to diſclaim all intereſt in, and <hi>Hope of Heaven,</hi> to <hi>embrace this preſent World,</hi> if we could be content to take up with the World for our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then certainly we have no ſound Hope of Heaven. It is a weighty ſaying, (O that it may be well weighed) <q>They are no true Hopes of Glory to come,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxt. Ep.</hi> ded. before his 32. Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> if you cannot caſt over board all Worldly Hopes, when the Storm is ſuch, that you muſt hazzard the One.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="11">(11.) A ſound Hope will raiſe ones Thoughts,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:92979:205"/>Heart and <hi>Deſires Heaven-ward.</hi> What is Hope, but an expectation with deſire, or a <hi>deſiring expectation?</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his <hi>earneſt expectation and Hope,</hi> Phil. 1.20. So we cannot have a lively Hope of Heaven, without lively deſires after Heaven. Rom. 8.23. <hi>We which have the firſt-fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Body.</hi> It cannot be that ſuch as have a ſound Hope of Heaven, ſhould place their happineſs, or terminate their deſires in the World.</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) A <hi>lively Hope</hi> will <hi>quicken</hi> and raiſe the Heart in praiſe and thankfulneſs to God. Pſal. 71.14. <hi>I will hope continually, and will yet praiſe thee more and more.</hi> This Hope is called <hi>good Hope through Grace,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.16. And Souls that have it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee cauſe greatly to admire, extol, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Divine Grace.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) Sound Hope is a furtherance of Spiritual <hi>Joy. Rejoycing in Hope.</hi> As <hi>Bernard, ſed nunquid tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae laetitiae ſpes erit ſine laetitia?</hi> Yea, this Hope oft cauſeth Joy even in Affliction. Pſal. 119.49, 50. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Word unto thy Servant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope. This is my comfort in my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for thy Word hath quickened me.</hi> The word of promiſe giving Hope, thus brings in Joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort too. Sound Hope will chear the Heart, and <hi>keep</hi> it <hi>alive</hi> under troubles, without which it would faint and ſink. If our <hi>Hearts die within</hi> us (like <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi>) under worldly Troubles, this would ſhew, we have not a <hi>lively Hope</hi> of Heaven. Such as <hi>rejoyce in Hope of the Glory of God,</hi> will be ready even to <hi>glory in Tribulations,</hi> as Rom. 5.2, 3.</p>

            <p>ANd ſo I come to the Trial of Mens <hi>Joyes.</hi> As there are <hi>counterfeit Graces;</hi> ſo there are <hi>falſe Joyes.</hi> As we read of the <hi>Hope of the Hypocrite,</hi> ſo likewiſe of the <hi>Joy of the Hypocrite,</hi> Job 20.5. A Joy that will end in ſorrow, and conſternation.</p>
            <p>Yea, It is poſſible for Souls that have true Grace, yet to be miſtaken in their Joys. As we find the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi> Diſciples returning <hi>with Joy,</hi> (Luk. 10.17.) <hi>ſaying, Lord, even the Devils are ſubject unto us through thy Name- Notwithſtanding</hi> (ſays Chriſt, v. 20.) in <hi>this rejoyce not, that the Spirits are ſubject unto you: but, rather rejoyce, becauſe your names are written in Heaven.</hi> Where he at once corrects, and directs their Joy. As one ſays, <q>Many times the more excellent a Sermon is,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>A. Burg.</hi>
                  </note> the more carnal the heart of the Preacher may be.</q> So Chriſtians may rejoyce <hi>carnally</hi> in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enlargements, and Spiritual Experiences. As <hi>Grace</hi> can find ſomething, even in natural comforts, to feed, and increaſe Spiritual Joy, Joy in the Lord; So <hi>Corruption</hi> ſometimes prevailes on the contrary, making Spiritual Duties, and Spiritual Priviledges and Mercies the matter and ground of carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
            <p>And further, as ſome Chriſtians through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs yield to <hi>needleſs fears,</hi> and take up ſad conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:92979:206"/>againſt themſelves, and their own Eſtates, debarring themſelves of comfort belonging to them; So others again through heedleſneſs, pleaſe themſelves erroneouſly in their own fancies, and <hi>rejoyce in ſparks</hi> of their own kindling, which they take for the comforts of the Spirit. That we ſhould not only try our Graces, but our Comforts. For which purpoſe take theſe following notes.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> is not wont to come in, till <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> hath prepared and made way for it.
<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
               <hi>Opportunè poſt triſtitiam gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium ſubit, poſt laborem quies, poſt naufra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium portus.</hi> Thus the Lord oft turns <hi>Water into Wine,</hi> turns his Peoples Sorrow into Joy. Chriſt was <hi>anointed,</hi> to <hi>give the Oyl of Joy for mourning, the Garments of Praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> Iſa. 61.3. <hi>They that ſow in Tears, ſhall reap in Joy,</hi> Pſal. 126.5, 6. Hearts that were never broken, are not yet prepared for Chriſt to bind them up. <hi>Paul</hi> had a caſting down to the Earth, before he was <hi>caught up to the third Heavens.</hi> They that have great elevations of Joy, and yet were never humbled for Sin, have cauſe enough to ſuſpect their Joy is not right.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Spiritual Joy hath the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> for its <hi>Authour.</hi> Thus it is the <hi>Joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.6. As I ſaid of a lively <hi>Hope,</hi> it is a <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. Miniſters may be <hi>helpers of</hi> a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <hi>Joy,</hi> (as 2 Cor. 1.24.) but under the Spirit. He is the <hi>principal efficient.</hi> Now they that have not the Holy Ghoſt their <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> cannot have him their <hi>Comforter.</hi> The Diſciples were <hi>filled with Joy, and with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 13.52. This fruit of the Spirit never grows alone: but hath other fruits accompanying it. Indeed there may be Saving,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:92979:207"/>Sanctifying Grace <hi>without actual Joy,</hi> and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: but there cannot be true Joy without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Sanctifying Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Spiritual Joy is never to be found without Saving <hi>Faith.</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>Now the God of Hope fill you with Joy and Peace in believing.</hi> No other way that it can be attained. Sound Joy is <hi>the Joy of Faith.</hi> Phil. 1.25. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God,—and rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.1, 2. Without true Saving Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, no Peace with God; and without Peace and Reconciliation with God, no ground for Joy. So then, if we would know whether our Joy be right, we muſt inquire after the truth of our Faith. Certainly a temporary Faith can have no betrer than a temporary Joy following it.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Spiritual Joy ordinarily is not attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſelf-probation, without <hi>ſelf-ſearching.</hi> Gal. 6.4. <hi>Let every Man prove his own work, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf.</hi> The ground of an Hypocrites Joy ordinarily is <hi>out of himſelf,</hi> in the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eſteem of others. But ſays the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our Conſcience.</hi> And this (we ſee) is the Scripture-way and method for attaining Spiritual Joy, to <hi>commune with our own Hearts,</hi> to ask our own Conſciences ſeriouſly, what evidence they can give that we are in a ſtate of Grace, that our works are done in <hi>Sincerity?</hi> And when Conſcience can <hi>give teſtimony</hi> of our God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sincerity, and Integrity, then indeed we have good ground to rejoyce. But therefore ſuch as are great ſtrangers to themſelves, and fear examining their Conſciences ſtrictly, leſt they ſhould tell them ſuch things, as they have no mind to hear, or know
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:92979:207"/>of themſelves, are not likely to have any other than a <hi>falſe Peace,</hi> and <hi>falſe Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Spiritual Joy uſeth to come in <hi>in a way of Prayer.</hi> Therefore in the want of it <hi>David</hi> betook himſelf to earneſt Prayer, Pſal. 51.8, 12. <hi>Make me to hear Joy and Gladneſs: that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce. Reſtore unto me the Joy of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Yea, he pleads this as an Argument with God, Pſal. 86.4. <hi>Rejoyce the Soul of thy Servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my Soul.</hi> So he pleads it for others, Pſal. 105.3. <hi>Let the Heart of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that ſeek the Lord.</hi> (If it be not rather a call to ſuch to rejoyce, and glory in him.) This advice and counſel Chriſt gave his dear Diſciples, Joh. 16.24. <hi>Ask, and you ſhall receive, that your Joy may be full.</hi> Chriſtians that are moſt Prayerful, are in the moſt hopeful way to be full of Joy too. But ſuch as neglect and deſpiſe Prayer, their Joy may well be queſtioned. There is juſt cauſe to fear, ſuch come not honeſtly by it, who count not ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies worth asking, who have it without begging for.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Another ordinary means of Spiritual Joy is attendance on God's Ordinances. Uſually it is in this way that it is given in, or increaſed. And therefore Ordinances have been a <hi>great Joy</hi> and comfort to the Faithful. As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was <hi>glad, when he thought of going into the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 122.1. So he <hi>rejoiceth at the Word, as one that findeth great ſpoil,</hi> Pſal. 119.126. So the Word to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was the <hi>Joy and rejoicing of his Heart,</hi> Jer. 15.16. No wonder that Ordinances are a <hi>matter of Joy</hi> to the Faithful, which are an ordinary means of the furtherance of their Joy. Iſa. 56.6, 7. There
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:92979:208"/>God promiſeth, that thoſe who <hi>joyn themſelves to the Lord to ſerve him,</hi> and <hi>keep the Sabboth from polluting</hi> it, ſhall be made <hi>joyful in the Houſe of Prayer.</hi> Iſa. 12.3. <hi>With Joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Which may be applied to God's <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as well as to <hi>Promiſes.</hi> They are <hi>breaſts of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> too. As here we may apply that, Iſa. 66.11. <hi>That ye may ſuck, and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of her Conſolations,</hi> &amp;c. This way indeed we might find comfort in Ordinances, if we come a thirſt to them, come with an appetite, and put forth the ſtrength of our affections in them, if we <hi>draw</hi> hard at theſe <hi>Wells,</hi> and ſuck at theſe <hi>Breaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they that cry down Ordinances as <hi>empty Forms,</hi> and <hi>dry Breaſts;</hi> they that count themſelves <hi>above</hi> Ordinances, what ever <hi>raptures of Joy</hi> they may ſeem to have, we have cauſe to think, they are only <hi>ſporting themſelves with their own deceivings.</hi> Some have caſt <hi>off Prayer,</hi> and <hi>giving of Thanks,</hi> ſome <hi>deſpiſe Propheſyings,</hi> ſlight and turn their backs on the Miniſtry of the Word; and yet pretend to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce evermore.</hi> But certainly the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was not <hi>of their way,</hi> ſee 1 Theſ. 5.16, 17, 18, 20. And the Joy of the Primitive Chriſtians came in another way, Act. 2.42, 46.</p>
            <p>Some again are full of confidence, becauſe they frequent God's Worſhip and Ordinances: like thoſe that cryed, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord.</hi> But there is little comfort to be taken in an outward attendance on Ordinances, without a Spiritual improvement of them. Yea, ſome that may <hi>fall away, have a taſte of the good Word of God,</hi> Heb. 6.5, 6. The <hi>ſtony-ground</hi> Hearers <hi>received the Word with Joy,</hi> Mat. 13.20. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:92979:208"/>gladly,</hi> Mar. 6.20. The unbelieving Jews, ſome of them, <hi>for a ſeaſon rejoiced in the Light</hi> of <hi>John's</hi> Miniſtry, Joh. 5.35. Some are taken with a Sermon ſometimes for the comfortable matter of it, or for the Abilities of the Preacher, his eloquent utterance or affectionate delivery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who yet are very far from that <hi>Spiritual delight,</hi> upright ones find in it. Theſe are not ſo taken with the <hi>Sound,</hi> as with the <hi>Power</hi> of it. They are beſt pleaſed with the Word, when it meets with their Corruptions, and does greateſt execution on them; when they have not only their <hi>affections moved</hi> in the preſent hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, but their <hi>Hearts eſtabliſhed</hi> by it; when they can find their Souls more quickened, and Grace actuated, and increaſed by it.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Spiritual Joy hath <hi>God</hi> for its cheif <hi>ultimate term,</hi> and Object. As it is called <hi>the Joy of the Lord,</hi> Neh. 8.10. The Joy of the Lord, <hi>non activè, ſed paſſivè,</hi> Joy in him. How oft are we called to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Lord?</hi> As the Pſalmiſt called God <hi>his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Joy.</hi> Pſal. 43.4. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God my exceeding Joy,</hi> or the <hi>gladneſs of my Joy,</hi> or my Joy and exultation. Pſal. 9.2. <hi>I will be glad, and rejoice in thee,</hi> Act. 2.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt make me full of Joy with thy Countenance.</hi> So a gracious Soul can greatly rejoice, if he has a ſenſe of God's preſence, notwithſtanding the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of creature-comforts. Hab. 3.18. <hi>Although the Fig-tree bloſom not, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 61.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my Soul ſhall be joyful in my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hence it appears, that ſuch as have not come to place their cheif delight and happineſs in God, are ſtrangers to Spiritual Joy.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) Spiritual Joy is alſo a <hi>rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> As he is the cheif and <hi>principal means</hi> to bring us
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:92979:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>to God. Rom. 5. <hi>We Joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by whom we have now received the atonement. The faithful are deſcribed, to be ſuch as worſhip God in the Spirit, and <hi>rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and have no confidence in the Fleſh, Phil. 3.3. As he rejoiced who had found <hi>the hid treaſure,</hi> Mat. 13.44. So do Believers rejoice, having found Chriſt, that rich Treaſure, and Pearl of greateſt price. 1 Pet. 1.8. — <hi>In whom believing, ye rejoice with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and full of Glory.</hi> Or, if ſometimes they walk heavily, 'tis becauſe they diſcern not their intereſt in him, or find not his preſence with them, as their Souls deſire. We can have no ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in God, but through Jeſus Chriſt, out of whom he is <hi>a conſuming Fire</hi> to Sinners. Therefore they that make no account of Chriſt, that ſee not their need of him, their miſery without him, that <hi>rejoice in ſparks</hi> of their own kindling, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding <hi>the Son of Righteouſneſs,</hi> have no ſound Joy.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) That is Spiritual Joy, when we are moſt taken with <hi>Spiritual Mercies.</hi> That is <hi>Joy in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oly Ghoſt,</hi> when we rejoice more in any experience of the gracious workings of God's Spirit in us, than in all outward earthly enjoyments. Or when we rejoice in outward Mercies <hi>upon a Spiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi> When we ſee them Bleſſings indeed, and <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified</hi> to us. When they ſteal not away our Heart from, but draw them nearer to God. When they are a means of <hi>increaſing our Love</hi> to God, of ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and encouraging our truſt and dependance on him, of engaging us to ſerve him with greater chearfulneſs and alacrity. Spiritual Joy, where it comes, exceeds, and (as we may ſay) <hi>ſwalloweth</hi> up carnal worldly Joy. The <hi>Joy of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:92979:209"/>is far more pleaſing than the <hi>Joy of Harveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">(10.) That is a kind of Spiritual Joy, when we heartily, unfeinedly <hi>rejoyce in the good of others.</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joy is promoted eſpecially by the <hi>Spiritual good</hi> of others. The good found <hi>in others.</hi> As when <hi>Barnabas ſaw the Grace of God</hi> among the Diſciples at Antioch <hi>he was glad,</hi> Act. 11.23. And when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had declared the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Gentiles, <hi>they cauſed great Joy unto all the Brethren,</hi> Act. 15.3. So <hi>Titus</hi> was comforted in the Believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Paul rejoiced</hi> much on their account, 2 Cor. 7.7. So <hi>David</hi> rejoyced to ſee the Peoples forwardneſs, 1 Chron. 29.17. <hi>And now have I ſeen with Joy thy People which are preſent here, to offer willingly unto thee.</hi> Pſal. 122.1. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, Let us go into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, when the Good vouchſafed <hi>to others</hi> is matter of Joy to us. Eſpecially the Good of God's Choſen. This may be ſpiritual Joy. To rejoice, and <hi>be glad with Jeruſalem,</hi> when ſhe is rejoicing; to be comforted with her conſolations, (as Iſa. 66.10, 11.) when it is not from a ſelfiſh, but a publick ſpirit, this is good.</p>
            <p>But they that <hi>rejoyce in iniquity,</hi> or <hi>rejoyce at</hi> others <hi>Calamities;</hi> they who rejoice over God's People in the day of their deſtruction, or of their diſtreſs, their Joy is ſo far from being right Spiritual Joy, that it is <hi>deviliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">(11.) Spiritual Joy is ſuch, as cannot be kept and maintained, but in a way of holy walking, and <hi>working Righteouſneſs. As it is Joy to the Juſt to do Judgment,</hi> Pro. 21.15. So <hi>the Lord meeteth him that rejoiceth, and worketh Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 64.5. <hi>Theſe
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:92979:210"/>things have I ſpoken unto you</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>that my Joy might remain in you, and that your Joy might be full,</hi> Joh. 15.11. Now what things were thoſe? ſee v. 7. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you—</hi> And v. 10. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love.</hi> Thus we can have no more evidence of the ſoundneſs of <hi>our Joy,</hi> than we have of the ſincerity of our <hi>Obedience.</hi> Pſal. 64.10. <hi>The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall be glad in the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonum vinum ex hydria purificationis hauritur,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, alluding to that, Joh. 2.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joy is drawn out of a <hi>pure Conſcience.</hi> A <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> that is <hi>peaceable,</hi> but not <hi>pure,</hi> is a meer <hi>cheat.</hi> Never expect to have Spiritual Joy in a courſe of Sin. Such a courſe as <hi>grieves</hi> the holy Spirit of God, will never bring a Man to true Peace and Joy.</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) Spiritual Joy quickens, and enlargeth the heart in God's Service. Joy <hi>dilateth,</hi> and enlargeth the heart:
<note n="*" place="margin">Laetitia q. laetitia.</note> So does Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joy. It enlargeth the heart in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is a great furtherance in God's ſervice, Rom. 14.17, 18. Spiritual Joy is as <hi>Oil to the Wheels.</hi> It makes Souls <hi>like the Charoits of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadib.</hi> How are Souls carried out for God when Spiritual Joy fills their <hi>Sails.</hi> This raiſeth the Soul. Trouble of Spirit is dejecting, <hi>[Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul!]</hi> And dejected ſpirits drive on but heavily in Duty. But Spiritual Joy elevates the Soul. To <hi>ſerve the Lord with gladneſs,</hi> is to be raiſed in his Service. Spiritual Joy will make Souls more <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> This would <hi>ſtrengthen weak hands,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:92979:210"/>feeble knees. The <hi>Joy of the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> Neh. 8.10. When <hi>Daniel</hi> hears the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, Dan. 10.19. <hi>O Man greatly beloved, fear not; peace be unto thee, be ſtrong, yea, be ſtrong:</hi> he could ſay, <hi>When he had ſpoken unto me, I was ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened:</hi> and then he ſaid, <hi>let my Lord ſpeak: for thoſe haſt ſtrengthened me.</hi> But there is no true comfort, or pleaſure to be taken in ſuch Joy, as does not further fit us for our work, and duty. Such Joy is but a flaſh.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) As was noted before of <hi>ſound Hope, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Joy</hi> is a ſpecial <hi>incentive</hi> to <hi>praiſe,</hi> and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As it comes in uſually <hi>in a way of Prayer;</hi> So it is wont to carry out the Soul in <hi>Praiſes.</hi> As we find theſe joyned, Pſal. 9.2. <hi>I will be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in thee:</hi> I <hi>will ſing praiſe to thy Name, O thou moſt High.</hi> And Pſal. 68.3, 4. <hi>Let the Righteous</hi> be <hi>glad, let them rejoice before God,</hi> yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. (Then it follows) Sing unto God, <hi>ſing Praiſes to his Name.</hi> Nothing puts the Soul in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>tune</hi> for praiſing God, than Joy in him. When a Soul is thus raiſed, and <hi>lifted up</hi> by him, it will be for <hi>extolling</hi> and lifting him up. Pſal. 30.1. <hi>I will extoll thee, O Lord, for thou haſt lifted me up.</hi> And v. 11, 12. <hi>Thou haſt turned for me my mourning into dancing: Thou haſt put off my Sackcloth, and girded me with gladneſs: To the end that my Glory may ſing praiſe to thee, and not be ſilent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</hi> So Col. 1.11, 12. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father,</hi> there followeth <hi>joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hath your Joy this effect? are you much in God's praiſe?</p>
            <p n="14">(14.) Spiritual Joy can <hi>keep alive,</hi> and <hi>keep the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:92979:211"/>Heart alive</hi> in the midſt of outward troubles. Hab. 3.18. <hi>Loquor quod expertus novit, inexpertus ignorat,</hi> (to borrow the expreſſion of <hi>Bernard</hi>) I ſpeak what the experienced Chriſtian knows, though the unexperienced neither apprehends, nor beleives it. Spiritual Joy will hold up a Mans Head in ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, under which others Hearts, that know nothing of it, would quite ſink, and be overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Yea, in ſufferings for Chriſt, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, this Joy is ſo far from being <hi>damped,</hi> that it is ordinarily more heightened; not checked this way, but increaſed. 2 Cor. 1.5. <hi>As the Sufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> Though Men may ſtrip the Faithful of their outward enjoyments; yet this inward <hi>Joy no Man can take away,</hi> Joh. 16.22. The Believing <hi>Hebrews took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> Heb. 10.34. Manifold Trials here could not daſh the Joy of thoſe, who by Faith foreſaw their future glorious Triumph. 1 Pet. 1.6. <hi>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a ſeaſon (if need be) ye are in heavineſs through manifold temptations.</hi> In this ſenſe alſo <hi>the Joy of the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> helping to bear the Croſs, not only patiently, but <hi>chearfully.</hi> As the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the preſence of the Council, <hi>rejoicing</hi> that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.42. Spiritual Joy is an <hi>Heavenly Spark,</hi> that floods of Trouble and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution cannot quench. And while Heaven ſmiles on a Saint, he cannot but rejoice, though the World frowneth.</p>
            <p>This Note may diſcover the Joy of many to be unſound. That Joy which <hi>openeth</hi> at the <hi>ſmiles of the World,</hi> and <hi>ſhuts</hi> at its <hi>frowns,</hi> is not <hi>a flower of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:92979:211"/>the Sun.</hi> That Joy which is born down with any Affliction that comes, is not like the Joy of the Spirit, which is called <hi>ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6.18.</p>
            <p n="15">(15.) Spiritual Joy is not <hi>ſwelling:</hi> But is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an <hi>humble frame</hi> of Spirit. Heart-humbling Grace is a neceſſary <hi>preparative</hi> unto, and a neceſſary <hi>preſervative</hi> of Heart-raiſing, and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Joys. Iſa. 29.19. <hi>The meek</hi> (or humble) <hi>ſhall encreaſe their Joy in the Lord, and the poor among Men ſhall rejoyce in the holy One of Iſrael.</hi> Such as are lifted up in themſelves, are not ſo fit for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as for a Caſting down. And one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhall have a <hi>Caſting down.</hi> If not in Mercy, and by <hi>Grace;</hi> then <hi>by force,</hi> and in fury. When a Child of God is growing proud of his Comforts, and Enlargements, he is in the ready way to loſe them. As I may ſay, <hi>Humility</hi> is the <hi>Save-all,</hi> and Prolonger; and <hi>Pride</hi> the <hi>Extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher.</hi> If you can keep your Joy and Pride toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is more than a Child of God can do.</p>
            <p n="16">(16.) Spiritual Joy is not <hi>intoxicating,</hi> but a ſober, ſerious thing, joyned with an <hi>holy Fear,</hi> Care, and Watchfulneſs. Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Rejoyce with trembling.</hi> When <hi>Daniel</hi> heard from God, that he was a Man <hi>greatly beloved,</hi> yet he <hi>ſtood trembling,</hi> Dan. 10.11. That is not right rejoycing in the Lord, which excludes Reverence towards him. And when he <hi>ſpeaks Peace,</hi> yet he expects better carriage of his People, than that they ſhould grow ſecure, and careleſs. He expects that they ſhould have a care, <hi>not to return again to Folly,</hi> Pſal. 85.8. Where he ſays, <hi>Be of good chear, thy Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee:</hi> He withal ſays, <hi>Sin no more,</hi> ſtand in in awe, and ſin not. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:92979:212"/>God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And by ſinning preſumptuouſly the Lord would be provoked to hide his Face again, to <hi>write bitter things</hi> againſt us. Thus new ſtorms of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would be raiſed.</p>
            <p n="17">(17.) Spiritual Joy would not put one upon a <hi>contemptuous carriage</hi> towards others: But rather make him full of Charity, and pity towards thoſe that want, and are ſtrangers to what he enjoys. Though <hi>a ſtranger doth not intermeddle with his Joy,</hi> (Prov. 14.10.) yet he cannot but deſire, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were partakers of the like. Pſal. 51.12, 13. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation: — Then will I teach Tranſgreſſors thy Wayes.</hi> I ſhall encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Sinners to come in, by thy merciful dealing with me, who have been ſo great a Sinner. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> chargeth <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was <hi>converted</hi> and reſtored, to <hi>ſtrengthen his Brethren,</hi> Luke 22.32. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> lays this down, as one <hi>end</hi> the <hi>Father of Mercies hath in comforting us, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any Trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4. And if we have not a tender pity towards poor troubled Spirits, and ſuch as have <hi>broken Bones;</hi> if we have no <hi>Wine and Oyl</hi> to pour into <hi>wounded Conſciences;</hi> if we are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for others under Spiritual Troubles, we may juſtly fear our Joy is not right.</p>
            <p n="18">(18.) Spiritual Joy will ſet Souls more on long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the <hi>Joys of Heaven.</hi> That Joy which comes from Heaven, will be raiſing the Heart up towards Heaven. Souls that have <hi>taſted that the Lord is Gracious,</hi> will thirſt after more, and long for the <hi>fulneſs of Joy</hi> in his Preſence, will breath
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:92979:212"/>after the full Enjoyment of God in Glory. 2 Cor. 5.5, 8. <hi>God hath given unto us the earneſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Therefore, — <hi>We are willing rather to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> If we have found any <hi>conſolation in Chriſt,</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him through the Lattices, how ſhall we deſire to ſee the King in his Beauty, and to ſee <hi>him Face to Face?</hi> Spiritual Joy will make Souls more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-minded, will very much take off the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from things on the Earth, and ſet them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things Above.</p>

            <p n="1">1. How do you aſſent to Divine Truth? 1. Do you aſſent Impartially? 2. Do you aſſent freely? Do you yield willingly to Divine Truth, as it is diſcovered to you? 3. Do you aſſent really? Have you more than an half-perſwaſion of the Truth? 4. Have you an holding Aſſent to the Truth? 5. Is it a Practical Aſſent? Does it draw on Conſent?</p>

And with a dependence on the Lord for Temporal Mercies, and Deliverance, as he ſees fit for you?</p>

            <p n="3">[3.] Try your <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Your ſorrow for Sin. Is it Godly ſorrow?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Is it on right grounds? 1. Is your ſorrow for Sin conſidered as a breach of God's Law? 2. as a diſhonour to God? 3. as diſpleaſing to him, as the abominable thing which he hates? 4. as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God's Mercies? as an ill requital of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

Are you ſo far troubled even for your unknown Sins, is it an humbling conſideration to think that you are guilty of many more Sins than you know of, or can find out in your ſelves? 9. Are you diſpoſed and inclined to mourn, for the Sins of others?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to the properties of your Sorrow. 1. Is your ſorrow and humiliation for Sin, free and voluntary? 2. Is it inward, and moſt in ſecret? 3. Is it not for a fit, but continued? 4. Is it deep, and vehement? Though the paſſion of Grief may be more moved at ſome great Croſs, and Affliction that has befallen you; yet do you really account Sin a greater evil than the greateſt Croſs?
